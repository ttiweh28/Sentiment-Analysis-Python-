        Added 19th March 2019 01:04 PM       ,Why Museveni will win come 2021,"What makes the NRM win? First, people vote for programmes.			googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1496656157133-0'); });		By Moses ByaruhangaTwo weeks ago the New Vision published my article titled Bobi Wine is the best thing to have happened to NRM. I pointed out that those who say that Museveni will loose the 2021 elections because in 2016 many people did not vote were not basing their analysis on facts. In 2016, 67% of the registered voters voted.			googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611395617-0'); });					googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611395617-0'); });		I also pointed out that Bobi Wine will be sharing the same supporters with Dr Kiiza Besigye, hence, the title of the said article that Bobi Wine is the best thing to have happened to NRM. I have since heard that some of the supporters of Bobi Wine attacked Dr Besigye when he was coming from a radio station.Over the weekend, I watched a clip where Dr Besigye was being asked if he supported Bobi Wine. In short Dr Besigye’s response was that there was nothing on which he would base his support to Bobi Wine because he had not come up with a rallying idea. This is a common problem with the opposition in Uganda. They come up with a common agenda that Museveni’s ‘agenda’ but they don’t offer their policies.Who is supporting Bobi Wine now? The very people who didn’t support Museveni in 2016 are the ones who support Bobi Wine. Today Bobi Wine is sharing them with Besigye and Gen. Muntu. If they were not a majority in 2016 what will make them a majority in 2021? One opposition MP told me that Bobi Wine was not electable material for the President, notwithstanding any following he has.This hype is not new. In 2015, I recall talking to a gentleman who was convinced that Amama Mbabazi was going to win. I told him that it was impossible for Amama to win. After the elections, I met him again and he said I was right in my analysis. When Bobi declared that he was ready for 2021, one would have expected the issues he will be addressing. I have heard those who say that after all we have had Amin before, surely, should we get another Amin?			googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611604321-0'); });					googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611604321-0'); });		Those who want to please themselves that this time they can defeat Museveni say that many new people have registered and they assume that the new people on the register will vote for Bobi Wine. Well, the facts are that in 2016, the voters’ register had 15 million voters. Out of these, 67% or 10 million voted and President Museveni obtained 5.9 million votes and Besigye had 3.5 million votes. President Museveni beat Dr Besigye with 2.4 million votes.				googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1501674790852-0'); });			As of today, the register has 17 million voters. Many people registered when it became compulsory that in order to register a phone, one had to have a National ID. Also, during the verification of public servants and pensioners, it was mandatory that one had to have an ID. So are all the new people on the register Bobi Wine supporters? The answer is No. These will be shared out among all the candidates.Out of the 17 million voters, if we have a 70% turn-up in 2021 that means 12 million voters will vote. In order to get 51% which is required for one to be declared a winner in Uganda’s Presidential elections, one needs 6,120,000 of the 12 million voters if 70% of the 17 million voters vote. Assuming that the 5.9 million voters that voted for President Museveni stay intact with him, he will need an additional 220,000 new voters for a simple win. For a comfortable win of at least 60%, he will need 7,200,000 of the 12m. This means he will need an additional 1.3 million votes.On the other hand, with the opposition’s 3.6 million including those who voted for Mr Amama Mbabazi, this being the starting point for the opposition, they will need 2.5 million votes to get a 51% win. If they are to aim at a 60% win, they will need an additional 3.6 million votes.I have used assumptions above but they are useful for any political analysis. It is clear that even if all the new voters on the register were to vote for the opposition, they still wouldn’t win. For them to win, NRM must lose a lot of supporters to the opposition. On the other hand, the NRM needs to mobilize a few new supporters for it to win. This is a simpler task. What the NRM has to do is to consolidate its support and win over a few others.What makes the NRM win? First, people vote for programmes. With the focus on the development of infrastructure i.e, roads and power generation and extension, the NRM that has been responsible for these programmes will get votes across the board whether Youth or older people. So those who argue that the youth will vote against President Museveni are simply misplaced. Yes, some will vote against him but many will vote for him. The youth and the others will vote for the programmes President Museveni has carried out and the new ones he will be promising. This is the reason President Museveni has been winning all along.Coupled with the above, is the organizational structure of the NRM. Out of 70,000 villages, the NRM has 30 leaders per village. This translates into 2.1 million voters. These have their own families who vote with them. You have the village Councils, Women Councils, Youth Councils and PWD. In all these, the NRM always has a majority. It will be a hard task for Bobi Wine or anyone in the opposition to have such organizational machinery like the NRM.At other levels, you have Councillors at Sub-county level and District level together with Sub-county Chairpersons and District Chairpersons. The NRM has about 80% of all the Councillors and Chairpersons above. These while campaigning for themselves also campaign for the NRM Presidential Candidate. They even put in their personal resources. At the National level, you have the MPs, 70% of whom are NRM. These will be campaigning for themselves and the NRM Presidential Candidate.It is impossible for the opposition or Bobi Wine for that matter to beat President Museveni come 2021.The writer is a senior presidential adviser on political affairs				googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });							googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });									googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1501674874561-0'); });					"

However, New Vision website is not sure whether that is the reason, he was arrested.During the press conference, Bajjo and his colleague Abby Musinguzi aka ABTEX revealed that they intend to organise a marathon to help Kyadondo East MP Robert  Kyagulanyi aka Bobi Wine to earn money he has lost over failed concerts.			googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611604321-0'); });					googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611604321-0'); });		Musinguzi also said money got from the Marathon will help the orphans whose parents died following deadly violence that ensued in Arua district as Bobi Wine was campaigning for Wadri Kassiano (MP elect).				googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1501674790852-0'); });			It is alleged that the fracas ensued after Kassiano’s supporters pelted stones on the presidential convoy, destroying the rear screen of one of his cars. The president was in the area to solicit votes for his party candidate Nusura Tiperu.He said Erias Lukwago wrote to Police notifying them of the event. However, they said the date of the marathon would be announced as soon as Bobi Wine returns to Uganda.In May 2019, Musinguzi and Bajjo trading as Abtex productions and Bajjo events and marketing agency Limited, respectively, sued Police and the Attorney General in the Civil Division of the High Court for refusing Bobi Wine’s from organising ‘kyarenga extra concerts’.The concerts had been organized in the districts of Kampala, Lira, Gulu, and Arua from April 22 to May 5, 2019 in vain.The events companies say that they had entered into an agreement with Bobi Wine and his crew to provide entertainment at 230m through the Easter festivities but the Police frustrated it.The two companies had paid a non-refundable booking fee to Bobi Wine constituting half of the total cost for the four shows.However, they say that they have since suffered economic loss as a result of the cancellation of the concerts.				googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });							googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });									googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1501674874561-0'); });					"

Also it is a statement that he is the best choice.			googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1496656157133-0'); });		Kyadondo East MP, Robert Kyagulanyi’s early declaration of running for president in 2021 is of concern to Opposition political parties and individuals.Popularly known by his stage name, Bobi Wine, the MP seems to have decided to go alone. Yet, the Opposition is mooting plans for a sole presidential candidate as a strategy to defeat President Yoweri Museveni and NRM in the next election.DP is weaving the one presidential candidate strategy. It started by dealing with internal conflicts. As a result, the Uganda Young Democrats, the party’s youth wing has reunited with the party.			googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611395617-0'); });					googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611395617-0'); });		And splinter factions like the Social Democratic Party, National Development Party and Truth and Justice have accepted to coexist in one party. There has also been a talk about DP-People Power union.As this process is going on, Bobi Wine self-proclaimed leaders of ‘People Power’ is on his own journey jeopardising DP’s bid for a joint candidate.By declaring his decision to stand for president, Bobi Wine is telling the Opposition that he has the strength and resources to run for the top job without them. Also it is a statement that he is the best choice.Therefore, if they want a discussion about a sole candidate, they will hold talks with him and also consider him for the position.Basically, there are four superficial factors that could have influenced his decision, which also sheds light on what politician he is. One, when he won the Kyadondo East seat in 2017 as an independent, he beat both the NRM and FDC flagbearers.As expected, of a party chairman President Yoweri Museveni attended the final rallies to campaign for William Ssebalu, the NRM candidate. Though not the party boss Kizza Besigye, former FDC president and presidential candidate rallied support for Apollo Kantinti.Besigye is the defacto leader of the Opposition. Also having unsuccessfully ran for president four times, he has become an elder of the Opposition and accepted as its face.Even with participation of the political heavy weights rallying support for their candidates, Bobi Wine won the race. This could have instilled confidence in the musician turned politician and tempted him to decide to run for president.Having defeated FDC candidates in a largely pro-FDC constituency, he thinks he is accepted by Opposition supporters (across the country) and these will be a base for him to win. And also by defeating the ruling party candidate makes him think the race for president will be a walkover as well.Two, 2018 by-elections - Bugiri Municipality and Arua Municipality- gave him a feeling of invincibility after his involvement in the campaigns, so he believes, resulted in a loss for NRM and FDC.Asumani Basalirwa (JEEMA) and Kassiano Wadri (Independent), who won the Bugiri and Arua seats respectively, were in the race with NRM and FDC candidates backed by their party officials.Bobi Wine could have used this to decide to declare his candidature early. He was the chief campaigner for both candidates. But it is still contested whether it was a result of their personal strength or his backing that earned them victory. It is a fact, the two politicians are known figures in Uganda politics and stood against weak candidates fielded by NRM and FDC. Therefore, it is possible that with or without him they could have won.The third factor is the talk that he has become the face of the Opposition. This stems from the fight he put up in Parliament during the debate on the Constitutional Amendment Bill in 2017. He emerged as the leader. The trade mark red beret fits him well and the slogan – People Power rolls off his lips musically.			googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611604321-0'); });					googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611604321-0'); });						googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1501674790852-0'); });			It has become his ‘thing’. Increasingly he seems to be contesting for the position of face of the Opposition with Besigye. His followers have read this clearly, that is why they are targeting the former FDC leader. Besigye himself knows this, but he is downplaying it so that he is not seen as antagonising the young politician.International limelight is the fourth factor that could have influenced Bobi Wine’s decision to run for president without talking it over with Opposition leaders.Following the fracas in Arua during the final by-election campaign rally in 2018, his arrest and alleged torture thrust him into international limelight. He was projected as a young politician who has emerged to challenge President Museveni.To the international media and community, the arrest, incarceration and charging in court were interpreted as persecution.

That there are many youths in Uganda, hence, the youth will vote for Bobi Wine. 			googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1496656157133-0'); });		By Moses ByaruhangaSince Bobi Wine came on the political scene and the emergence of “People Power”, I have listened to many programmes on radio where the commentators give an impression that should Bobi Wine offer himself for presidency, he is likely to win. Many people who make comments to such effect don’t base themselves on good analysis.  This kind of talk also scares our supporters who too don’t go into deep analysis of political issues in the country.Those who say that Bobi Wine is a big threat base on some of the following illusions: That elections in Uganda have been rigged in the past.  That there are many youths in Uganda, hence, the youth will vote for Bobi Wine. That in the last elections, many Ugandans did not vote, so if they come out and vote this time round, those who never voted will vote for Bobi Wine.Let me start with the last illusion that many Ugandans never voted in the last elections. According to the statistics available with the Electoral Commission, the voter register for the 2016 general elections had 15,277,131 registered voters. Out of these, 10,329,131 or 67.61% cast their vote. So those who say that many Ugandans never voted while voter turn up was close to 70%, did they expect 100% voter turn up? It has never happened in any democracy in the world that you get a voter turn up of 100%. The highest we have ever got in Uganda in recent times was in 1996 when voter turn up was 73%.  Even if voter turn up in 2016 was 75% of the registered voters and President Museveni maintained 5,971,872 votes he obtained, he would still have won albeit with a smaller margin. So those who say that many people didn’t vote in 2016 and that if they are mobilized to vote come 2021, President Museveni will lose don’t know what they are talking about.The assertion that the youth are a majority, hence, they will vote against President Museveni, is a fallacy. Since when have the Youth in Uganda been few?  In all these elections President Museveni has won, the Youth have always been a majority. What influences a youth voter in Uganda? Like all other voters, the youth voter is influenced by the achievements of the NRM and what the NRM promises to handle in its manifesto. A youth in an area that is generally an NRM strong hold will vote for the NRM and related to this, is the fact that if a family is NRM, the youth in that family will vote for the NRM.  This is also true if that family is in opposition. The NRM is the only party in Uganda with a vibrant Youth League with 350,000 Youth Leaders at village level.  If each of these NRM Youth Leaders is tasked to bring on board 10 Youth voters in their villages, that can mobilize 3,500,000 Youth voters.  That is almost what Besigye obtained in 2016. He obtained 3,508,687 votes or 35.61%.  So to the NRM people, don’t be scared at all by this Bobi Wine political fever. In fact, Bobi Wine is the best thing to have happened to the NRM. The big effect Bobi Wine has had on the political scene is to split the opposition. Many of the supporters of Bobi Wine are the same people who never voted for President Museveni or the NRM.  So the 3.5 million voters who voted for Besigye in 2016 are the ones who are mainly following Bobi Wine.  If  Besigye was to count his supporters today, he will definitely get less because some of them are with Bobi Wine.  My analysis is that Besigye has lost most of his grass root supporters in the urban areas while he could still be retaining the ones in the rural areas. Among the elite, Besigye has lost some supporters to Gen. Mugisha Muntu. This to me is the best thing to have happened to the NRM. I don’t see Besigye, Muntu and Bobi agreeing to one candidature come 2021.  With each one thinking that they can make it, the NRM Presidential candidate will simply sail through. Why will Ugandans vote for President Museveni come 2021 if he offers himself as a candidate? I will write more on this separately, but suffice to note is that Uganda under President Museveni has seen a lot of development in infrastructure like roads and electricity, where now we are targeting every sub county, UPE, USE, Health Services like immunization, provision of water in the rural areas, etc.  The people where a new tarmac road passes even if they are not using it for their economic benefit, will mainly vote for the NRM.As NRM we have had challenges in urban areas.  Here we don’t perform well because we have not addressed urban issues adequately.  The interventions the President has made in Kampala in the recent past of giving tools and capital to Youth groups in Kampala/Wakiso area will have a positive effect on how these Youth will vote in 2021.  We have had interventions in Kampala in the past and the political effect was remarkable.  What the NRM has to do is to intensify on the projects in the urban areas targeting the youth so that we end the protest vote we get from the urban voters.  The youth in rural areas too should be engaged by the NRM leaders.On the question that the elections in Uganda are rigged, hence, if there is no rigging President Museveni will lose, this is based on a falsehood.  Besigye and the opposition use this to explain their failure to win.  After the last elections, Besigye called for International Auditors.  He has never told us what he thinks he obtained. To make it simple, all the results for each polling station can be found on the Electoral Commission Website.  For those who follow electoral processes in Uganda, each candidate has a right of being represented at each polling station by two agents.  The agents of all the candidates witness the counting of the votes after voting time elapses.  When all the ballots are counted, the results are entered in a Result Declaration Form which is supposed to be signed by the agents of all the candidates confirming the results entered on the Form to be authentic. If for any reason one of the agents has reason to doubt the results entered, he/she signs giving reasons why he/she doesn’t agree with the said results.  The EC in Kampala reads results coming from the polling stations around the country.  Can anyone point out a polling station where the results posted by the EC on their website are different from what their agent had at that particular polling station?  If Besigye in the audit he was calling for can come up with Declaration Forms with results different from what the EC has, I would give him audience. There have been incidences of ballot stuffing, even where it has been proved in court, the issue is that if all the total votes at polling stations where such incidences took place are added, they wouldn’t affect the results of the winner in a substantial manner.  Meaning that even if you repeated the elections because of such irregularities, the one who won would still win.  I bring out this because there are those who say that in the Besigye petitions, Museveni survived by only one or two judges.  They try to create an impression that had a majority of the judges ordered for a repeat of election, Museveni would lose.  Well it happened in Kenya where the election was annulled and President Kenyatta still emerged as a winner. In the 2016 elections, President Museveni defeated Besigye with 2.4 million votes. How would Besigye recover that in a repeat election because there were irregularities in a few polling stations? The NRM only needs to consolidate its 5.9 million voters and add on more to win in 2021.The writer is a senior Presidential Adviser on Political Affairs				googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1496657157715-0'); });							googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });							googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });									googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1501674874561-0'); });					"

He is yet to convince me to join his political camp,” Pastor Wilson Bugembe said as he addressed journalists in Kampala on Tuesday.Bugembe is facing a backlash from some pastors for accepting to be part of Bobi Wine’s political song Tuliyambala Engule, originally a gospel hymn sung in the Luganda language, spoken largely in central Uganda.Bobi Wine’s version of the song that features Pastor Bugembe and a number of other local artists has been viewed as an attack on the government.“I don’t want to fight government as a born again Christian, my individual thought is that government hasn’t treated us so badly. We Pentecostal’s have had immeasurable freedom to worship under President Museveni,” Bugembe said.“When I was asked to do the song, I was asked to be unifier in the song for all the political parties. In my heart, I was happy to be the peacemaker.“I remember when we were shooting the video for the song, we didn’t have caps for all parties.

He says he was about making peace and representing the church in the song.First to criticize Pastor Bugembe for singing in Bobi Wine’s song was Makerere Community Church Pastor, Martin Sempa.Equally critical of Bugembe’s involvement in the song was Pastor Serwadda of Victory Christian Church in Ndeeba. They believe that he should not mix God with politics.However, Bobi Wine says the power and energy those pastors are exerting on people who fight injustice should instead be diverted to fighting injustice.He says Bugembe was threatened and his reaction to the current criticism was expected. ""What Bugembe said was right because he was probably being threatened. They never attacked him when he sung in Tubonga nawe, I wonder why they chose to attack him in a song like this one,” Bobi Wine wondered.“Above all, I wonder why its men of God that are attacking him.

I don’t have any political ambitions and I shouldn’t be misunderstood because I just highlighted the issue and the message is very clear,” Ntale says.Like Bugembe, King Saha also sung in the Tubonga Nawe song.In Tuliyambala Engule he sings on how when taxes are reduced, and farmers able to get market for their produce, Ugandans will wear the victor’s crown.This is the first song and video to be released in the year 2019.

It has caused a delay into the completion of the work,” Lasumbu told court throwing the congregation into laughter.He also said most of the APPs have been handed back except the mobile phones.In a similar submission, Herbert Wanyoto the West Nile Regional CID said police has 20 mobile phones in custody but they’ve found it difficult to continue with investigations.“In the sense that the accused persons are uncooperative by way of volunteering their passwords or thumb prints, it is in the interest of justice that this court compel the concerned persons to avail those passwords to the police for the success of the investigation,” Wanyoto requested court.In response, Tonny Kitara the defense counsel rejected the plea adding that the accused persons are by law protected not do self-incrimination.Status of other propertiesThe regional police CID also told court that vehicle registration number UAX 354E land cruiser belonging to Ariko Herbert, the MP Soroti municipality which was in possession of Gerald Karuhanga was returned back.Lusambu had earlier told court that a grader UAP 064R and UAT 416K Toyota Tundra pickup are in police custody but the owners are not among the accused.Other cars whose owners are in court are; UAW 207A a land cruiser and UAU 918N Toyota Kulger. However, a pistol Number D4627 with 12 rounds of ammunition whose owner was also in court is on a different case.In what seem to have puzzled the defense team, Counsel Fredrick Ronald Kalule, said the submission by the two police officers was by far missing a lot property for his clients.These include; money, knickers, pads, wedding rings, car keys and shoes and therefore asked court to intervene and order for their return.Police accused of using the accused’s phonesShiraj Nalunga Rashida also a defense Counsel told court that police is rather playing tricks. She noted that police use the phones of some accused persons to call their spouses, friends and issuing them with threats. She cited an example where Hon. Kyagulanyi’s phone was used to call the wife and friends.The police officers appeared in court following court order that Arua and Gulu district CID explain the state of the properties of the accused persons.Ronald Were, the former Gulu district CID boss told court that when he interacted with the accused persons, they did have their belongings after being transferred from Arua.Defense ask court to refer the caseReferring the court to the Ruling of the Constitutional court on case of Dr. Kizza Besigye Vs the Attorney General of 2007, No.7, Tonny Kitara, the defense Counsel said the accused in the case was severely tortured and his rights were grossly violated but was later exonerated.Kitara who also submitted a copy of the ruling prayed to court to dismiss/discontinue the trail against all the accused persons, in the unlikely event that court does not dismiss the case, the court rather stay all the proceeding and refer to the constitutional court or court stay the proceedings in the case to give time to petition constitutional court challenge the proceedings.State rejects plea by defenseJulius Ocen the prosecutor said while it is true citizens should claim for their rights and freedoms provided for by the constitution, it should be noted that the citizens have duties to respect the constitution.Ocen added that state organs cannot just sit and watch citizens as they go on rampage. On other note, the prosecutor told court that investigations into the matter are almost complete.He said the delay had been caused by the absence of A36 (Hon. Francis Zake the MP Mityana municipality).The mentioning that started at about 9:50am and concluded at 12:00pm was adjourned by Kintu to July 4, 2019.Case backgroundA total of 36 suspects are facing Treason charge after being accused of throwing stones at one of the motorcade in the Presidential convoy in Arua municipality.

The prosecution side was also given an opportunity to present their submission against bail for the legislator.Kyagulanyi, the accused, followed proceedings remotely from Luzira Prison via the video conferencing system. He stood in a prison court dock, flanked by two prison officers, throughout the session.After about three hours of proceedings, the trial magistrate, Esther Nahirya, decided to stand over the session for an hour, to allow her time to prepare the judgement on the bail application.The verdict is expected at around 2pm local time.Kyagulanyi was at the beginning of this week remanded to Luzira Prison after being charged with disobedience of statutory duty.The charge sheet tendered before court showed that the musician-turned-politician faces charges of offences he allegedly committed last year. He is said to have held a public meeting without giving notice to any authorized officer or Police.In its submission, the state argued that the court needed to ""strike a balance between the individual rights of the applicant and the rights of society at large"".The state attorney arguing against bail for Kyagulanyi ""The balance can only be well-struck by maintaining the applicant in safe lawful dentention facilities, like where he is at,"" said the state attorney.""In doing so, the accused's rights of safety will be maintained along with the right of other members of society.""In response, the defence side submitted that "" the right to liberty of an individual is a fundamental right"" and is ""next only to the individual's right to life"".For his bail application, Kyagulanyi presented MPs Patrick Nsamba (Kassanda North), Gaffa Mbwatekamwa (Kasambya County) and former ethics and integrity minister Miria Matembe to stand surety for him.The prosecution side punched holes in the trio.The accused, MP Robert Kyagulanyi, followed proceedings remotely via video conferencing To begin with, the state attorney said that at 64, Matembe, a former member of the Pan-African Parliament, is of advanced age and is ""not visibly capable to compel the applicant to adhere to the orders of court"".And about the other sureties: ""The two are co-equals of the accused person and do not have any legitimate authority over the applicant"".The state argued: ""For a person to qualify as a substantial surety, consideration is not merely based on status or prestige. The sole consideration is that the surety should be capable of compelling the accused person to appear in court. It is my submission that the sureties presented can only merely request the applicant to report to court, which request can be ignored.""On the place of abode, the prosecution argued that considering that Kyagulanyi lives in Magere, Wakiso district, the Buganda Road Chief Magistrates Court has no jurisdiction over the residence of the applicant.But while all the sureties present also reside ""way outside"" the jurisdiction of the court, ""the law does not require the sureties to have a place of abode within the court's jurisdiction - unlike the applicant "", prosecution added.The defence team's Samuel Muyizi Mulindwa said: ""The test to be applied is a qualitative test - and this court can take judical notice that the sureties have well known public known residences.""Defence lead counsel Asuman Basalirwa ubtantiality has no relation with age ""They [sureties] have a clear public nexus and private bond with the accused person,"" said lead defence counsel Asuman Basalirwa.""Subtantiality has no relation with age. One of them is a neighbour [Matembe] and the other two are MPs who are always in Parliament with him.  They have influence over him. Bail must not be hinged on financially ability,"" he said.On the state's recommendations that if the accused is to be granted bail, it should be sh10m and cash, Basalirwa said that their client, being also a musician, had over 100 concerts of his cancelled.He was also critical of the video conferencing system to conduct the bail application hearing, saying that ""if it was not for the liberty of our client"", they would not have submitted to the use of this mode of the application.The lawyer called it an ""ambush"", saying they were ""not able to consult with our client"". When offered a chance by the magistrate to speak, cautioning him to ""refresh from political phrases"", Kyagulanyi said: ""My business is standing for the truth. My business is standing for what is morally right"".""If standing for what is right will keep me in prison, then I will thank God even more,"" he said.After the magistrate broke off the session, Kyagulanyi's supporters chanted inside the packed courtroom.Also related to this storyBobi Wine back in court via video conferencing				googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1496657157715-0'); });							googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });							googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });									googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1501674874561-0'); });					"

        Added 25th July 2019 11:41 AM       ,Bobi wine&#39;s campaign team is shaky,"One wonders how a person is appointed mobiliser and in a few hours time he rejects the appointment, that means either he wasn't consulted or he was being forced to do something he didn't support or like			googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1496656157133-0'); });		OPINION By Sam Evidence Orikunda On Thursday evening, Babu Owino went to his Facebook wall and posted that Bobi wine will defeat president Museveni in the election and other words he added. This is the same enthusiasm that most fans of Bobi wine have to the extent that some photoshop his pictures while sitting in state House, inspecting the guard of honor and other childish things they do on social media. Also yesterday, few hours after the People power spokesperson Joel Senyonyi announcing the names of people who will be doing mobilisation in different regions of Uganda on behalf of people power and Bobi wine as an individual two people disowned and rejected the appointments. One member of Parliament said he wasn't consulted and he didn't know what people power was all about and therefore they should remove his name. The days Bobi wine and his team have been traversing the whole country looking for votes and sometimes in his private business one would expect them now to have people they've sat with convinced and agreed that they work towards his Presidential ambitions that he has been telling the people of Uganda about. One wonders how a person is appointed mobiliser and in a few hours time he rejects the appointment, that means either he wasn't consulted or he was being forced to do something he didn't support or like. Why would someone turn down an appointment to Mobilise? This happens when people have no trust or hope in that Political movement, otherwise, it would have been seen as an opportunity to be part of the winning team and everyone would be dying for it. Imagine if president Museveni nominated someone to be his minister and that person rejects the offer? It would make news indeed and it would be laughable. Surprisingly most people from the opposition when they're appointed they take up positions wholeheartedly and recently one of them Nakiwala fully joined the Movement and I take the opportunity to welcome her. On the day Gen Mugisha Muntu unveiled his Political party, I followed closely. His party introduced people who will be helping the party to do mobilisation in different parts of the country up to grassroots.  His team had youth, women and old men. Some people whose names were announced surprised many because we didn't know that they indeed had support for the ANT. From that day when their names were put in public nobody has ever come out to reject that appointment and I guess they've been doing the work they were assigned to do. In fact, when you talk anything negative about the ANT people will not tell you that they exist and they're working underground seriously and its true they've always proved this right when it's their time to put something in public everyone gets surprised. Because something done in silence surprises many. However I wouldn't want to compare people power so much with ANT am only trying to relate the two Political movements that have come up in the last few years as we get closer to the General Elections and also trying to torch through their capability. Whereas people power and their leader Bobi Wine have the media coverage of both our indigenous media houses and the international but they lack strategy and clear planning. No wonder Bobi wine struggles to answer Questions each time he appears on Television, had they been serious, he would be coached by now and equipped by necessary information when appearing in the eyes of the public for debate. Politics is all about speaking and strategy so if people power doesn't have strategies how then will they achieve their goals? I think one thing they should have thought about would be forming a Political party which would give them a platform, path and political home. How will they introduce themselves to the law enforcement agencies when they're carrying out their work? Won't they be stopped? I think the police will want to know if they're known by the electoral commission hence giving them green lights but if Electoral commission disowns them then they will be stopped because their activities will be illegal. I think it's the same reason as to why People power keeps switching sides, today they're with DP bloc, tomorrow with FDC and another day with UPC..it's the same reason as to why media has kept on speculating news of the people power pressure group merging with FDC to have one Candidate. This happens because when Bobi wine gets closer to Besigye journalists keep guessing that they're planning a union and they immediately put in the news, the same thing happens when Bobi wine gets closer to Mugisha Muntu. It's also evident that after announcing their teams both FDC and Besigye's people's government wrote messages conveying their wishes of good luck. This happened because they all have interest and they would want to fish from people power.  I usually hear people say that ""When you're everywhere, you're nowhere"". At the end of the day people  power will be nowhere because some Political groups will start getting offended like for instance one wonders why the DP bloc hasn't said anything and why most people in the DP bloc were intendingly left out in Bobi Wine's team? You also remember that previously there was serious rift between supporters of Kiiza Besigye and those of Bobi wine, this happened for a while and the war was on social media.FDC top most leaders were involved. I remember reading different Facebook posts  from Ingrid Turinawe attacking people power no wonder when she was made to sit with Bobi wine at a certain function recently she gave a strange facial expression which was caught on camera leaving several people stunned..all this is happening because people power is trying to have a room in every Political party house  something which is very difficult because they won't be welcome in all those houses. I ask my self Questions how difficult was it for people power to register as a political party? What's it's future as a political pressure group? Do they remember pressure groups like 4GC , Reform agenda and several others? Where are they and what happened to them? How sure are we that the same disease that killed them won't attack people power? The truth of the matter is once a Political pressure group comes, it catches the attention of the media hence becoming popular. Wise Politicians take advantage of that popularity to get what they want quickly and once they get it you can never hear them again associating themselves with that pressure group..but a Political party starts struggling and at the end of the day it gets strength. That's if the members are serious and focused on building the party. The MP Mbwa Takamwa being appointed to head the Ankole region in the mobilisation of people power shows how shaky their team is, one wonders how an MP representing a Constituency in the central region will go to the west do mobilsation. This is like sending a Moslem to go and preach the gospel of Christ in the cathedral. Does he have any contacts in Ankole? Will people have time for him? Will the Politicians in that area make it easy for him? All those questions have answers in negative and therefore that's the first evidence that the team is too shaky and crumbling.  Secondly, while perusing through the list, I couldn't see anybody representing Kigezi, I therefore concluded that there was no single representative in that region. I was later informed that one young man, who was one time trounced in a  Parliamentary election with almost zero votes was appointed to lead Kigezi. I doubt if he knows or if he has visited all the Districts of Kigezi. Remember this is the Kigezi which has several veteran and senior Politicians in Uganda including the country's Prime Minister so if we are to compare the capacity and mobilsation skills where do we put people power boys perhaps at a very worrying losing side. For a person to win an election or make an impact that person must be having a strong team not shaking and that team should be growing daily. Nobody should be disembarking or resigning they should instead be bringing other teams. In times when one disowns then it leaves the others worried, losing confidence and trust of what they're supporting.  Imagine making a car and someone who made it refuse to take part in taking that vehicle for road test? Perhaps you who didn't even contribute to it's making you get worried and I think someone sensible can't continue with the road test. Finally now that the team was announced to the public. We wait to see what they've been having in store, We wait to see the energy their supporters use to insult whoever talks negative on people power, We wait to hear people changing from FDC and other parties to people power, We wait to see everyone dressed in red and chanting people power and lastly we wait to see them making Bobi wine president.    The writer is an aspirant western Youth Member of Parliament				googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1496657157715-0'); });							googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });							googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });									googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1501674874561-0'); });					"

A number of people, including some Members of Parliament, were in court waiting for proceedings to kick off, New Vision's Farooq Kasule reported.For this session, matters would be conducted differently today. Legislator Kyagulanyi was due to apply for his bail application after he was remanded to Luzira Prison on Monday after being charged with disobedience of statutory duty.The charge sheet tendered before court showed that the musician-turned-musician faces charges of offences he allegedly committed last year. He is said to have held a public meeting without giving notice to any authorized officer or Police.On Thursday, New Vision's Kasule reported that Judiciary spokesperson Solomon Muyita had confirmed that Kyagulanyi's bail application hearing would be conducted via video conferencing.The system, introduced mid-April this year, links Buganda Road Chief Magistrates Court to Luzira Prison.  Chief Justice Bart Katureebe  commissioned the virtual courts on April 15, where inmates and witnesses off-site can attend court through video conferencing.The system can connect magistrates to Luzira prison's virtual courts fitted at the male and women's wings using video conferencing facilities.

I have called this memo backdated because from the look of things, General Mugisha Muntu seems to have learnt and is acting, unlike Dr Besigye and his FDC.			googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611395617-0'); });					googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611395617-0'); });		When General Muntu tried to gain a grip on FDC’s top position and lost, he learnt that it is better to be patient when things don’t work out your way, and where necessary that you make hard decisions rather than keeping the attitude of entitlement.Dr Besigye, warm regards and good wishes from me. Sir, your address and People’s Government analysis of our country’s situation has reminded me of something great that is missing in opposition. A great Moment which Chinua Achebe described; a moment when men were men and women liked it that way. A moment when men had to make hard decisions and accept reality even when they did not like it!That moment men would assess the situation and moods of the time and adjusted in their choices accordingly. This is the moment FDC has failed to realise. They have failed to study the time and adjust their needs and choices. Doctor Besigye sir, the country is tired of politics! My memo, therefore, is a call for leadership, not politics.FDC’s failure to study the moods and times and know what Ugandans want has left us in the age of what Scholars Livit and Dubner described as Freakonomics. The age when things do not add up. Today, you declare the so-called People’s Government, tomorrow you accuse the government of failing to work for Ugandans. You campaign for your ‘tubalemese’ and tomorrow you accuse the government of not delivering to your expectations.			googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611604321-0'); });					googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611604321-0'); });		Put differently, FDC’s politics does not add up. Actually, your politics has forced me to ask; of what use to man is his politics? Though Aristotle taught us that man is is a political animal, my question is how does politics help him? To enslave him as a lamenter? Or to depict man as a source of doom and announcer of catastrophe as was seen during your State of People Address?				googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1501674790852-0'); });			Doctor Besigye sir, the second point in this memo is about you. And because I am speaking to a retired colonel, I will be very sincere sir. Once you stop politicking and chose the leadership path, Ugandans will be very happy and even president Museveni as a revolutionist will feel happy that the country is safe. He will, therefore, make a way for you. It is called REALPOLITIK.In the bible, we learn that Esau spent much of his time doing politics. On the other hand, his twin brother Jacob spent much of his time at home. He did not show an attitude of entitlement but shunned politicking, was never in rallies or defiance campaigns but remained home thinking and plotting how he would inherit his father. In the end, Esau lost and Jacob won.Sir, unless you stop politics and take leadership way, you should not be surprised when Kyadondo East legislator Robert Kyagulanyi appears as Jacob leaving you as Easu. Or will he?Doctor Besigye sir, for emphasis, my third point in this memo is that please read rhythm of the time. Preaching defiance or Tubalemese is not what Ugandans want but rather they would like to hear positive ‘vibes’. We would like to hear ‘positive vibes’ like what president Museveni tells us. Stories such as more roads are being constructed, more factories are coming up to create jobs and employment opportunities for Ugandans.Since the president is already telling us such positive vibes and probably you don’t believe in them, please don’t preach Tubalemese or defiance but rather, suggest other ways how things can be better in your view. This is called alternative or positive criticism; you can also call it leadership!Sir, in my view, it is wise to engage with the mood of the nation, don’t follow the wishes of some radicals in FDC or oracles’ wishes. Sir, don’t even dare follow instructions of habit. You may have trust issues with some Ugandans or president Museveni, but remember politics, not about trust, trust is about romance and politics is about interests. Whether you trust president Museveni or the president trusts you, that is not primary.Actually, it is irrelevant. Leadership is not about hugs and kisses; neither is it about romance. It is about interests. And the interest of people you all want to lead are the same: we want leadership, not politics because its leadership that will, in turn, give us services and jobs that many youths want. Becoming a president is not an entitlement, it is Ugandans interests that can make you a president, sir. This is the reason I am politely inviting you to shift from politics to leadership.Politics is about elections and leadership is about the next generation. Politics is about action; leadership is about vision. And like Moses in the holy bible, a leader does not excite crowds. His speech can even be limited. Instead, a leader directs crowds, with speech or without it. That is why he is called a leader.To Bobi Wine, you’re in a prisoner’s dilemma. In Greek Mythology, Daedalus was imprisoned with his son Icarus. While in prison with his son Icarus, Daedalus decided to use his expertise of craftsmanship to escape from prison. Using feathers and wax, he crafted two sets of wings one for himself and the other for his son to fly and escape from the prison. Prior to their escape, Daedalus warned his son Icarus to remain humble.Put differently, he told him not to be excited and fly too high since this would expose him to sun’s heat and melt his wings. Because he was young, Icarus ignored the father’s advice and flew closer to the sun and the wax in his wings started melting. Consequently, Icarus tumbled from the sky and fell into the sea and drowned sparking the idiom; ""don't fly too close to the sun"". Bobi Wine, the office of president is made out of feathers with wax and if you want that office, you cannot fly too high else your wax will melt and you will fall and drawn.However, if you fly low, you may live longer and grow old like Daedalus and you will thus enjoy and become boss.The writer is a PhD student of International Relations and Diplomacy and author of Global Governance and Norm Contestation: How BRICS is Reshaping World Order				googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });							googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });									googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1501674874561-0'); });					"

I lived in Apac for three years while working as a head of enforcement for fisheries law on Lake Kyoga and I made many friends in the region.On the bus, I was seated next to a young lady who from her physical appearance looked to be in her early 20’s and she told me she was a Langi from Kole district. She sounded knowledgeable, bright and very fluent in English. On reading the newspaper headline, she exclaimed “I cannot vote for this man just because he is still young. For me, I have never voted, but this time around I have already picked my National ID and am going to register purposely to vote for Museveni because he is an exceptional father who has brought up his children in a God-fearing manner, well disciplined, have respect for people and are free of any controversy”			googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611604321-0'); });					googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611604321-0'); });		Her statement excited me and I asked her “You look young, but you sound mature where do you get this confidence?” Looking at me in the face she said “Our parents narrate to us of ugly stories of how children of the past leaders used to misbehave in public, but this is not the case of the children of our current President and many students at campus talk about it and praise him (Museveni) for that.”				googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1501674790852-0'); });			After reading a few paragraphs of the Bobi Wine story, she covered it and handed it back to me smiling and said “Personally I don’t see a national character in Bobi Wine. All I see is Bobi Wine the singer and MP.”This young lady’s testimony was spot-on because I personally witnessed how well behaved, adoring, disciplined, lovely, caring and down to earth the President’s family is. A few years ago, I attended the burial of the Late Maama Erina Rwabwogo the mother to Odrek Rwabwogo a son-in-law to the President at Rushere village in Kiruhura district.Rwabwogo whom we mobilise together for NRM in Bunyoro texted me informing me of the death of his mother from a Nairobi Hospital and I travelled to Rushere together with my friends Hussein Magezi and Geoffrey Sunday Byenkya both taxi drivers for the burial. During lunchtime, after the burial, we were shocked when the three of us were invited for lunch and shared the same table with the president’s daughters, all his sons in law and other members of the first family. We were accorded a special treatment for the two days spent at that home. It was incredible.God gave to Ugandans and Africa, in general, the Amos Kaguta family as a blessing and special gift. A family with power and authority, but well disciplined, well mannered, obedient, down to earth, generous and with a huge sense of feeling for others.Last year, I led a delegation of 20 people from Hoima district to visit General Salim Saleh at his Kapeka home in Nakaseke district. Saleh served his visitors with happiness and excitement and shared the same table during mealtime with them. At one point he guessed that the Hoima District Khadhi, Sheik Ashiraf Kugonza was uncomfortable and asked him “Sheikh you are uncomfortable it seems you want to go for prayers.” Sheikh Kugonza answered in affirmative. Gen. Saleh led Kugonza and allowed him to perform his Dhuhur prayers (Afternoon players) in his house.Therefore, when the Kole young lady revealed to me that her main reason why she was going to vote President Museveni in 2021 is because of his (Museveni’s) role as a good father of disciplined and God-fearing children I got happier and energised because I realised the President I have supported and campaigned for, for decades has all the qualities of a good leader.There are so many factors voters consider while choosing leaders at various positions of leadership and these include individual merit and the behaviour of the leader plus the achievements that leader has registered over a period of time he or she has been in the office. Many Ugandans vote for Museveni because of his personality. He is a good leader and cares for ordinary people (wananchi).The opposition believes that by keeping feeding Ugandans on false hopes (pipe dreams) and putting on red caps, misusing the media a product of the NRM Government and maligning the Museveni led Government are strong and can win the 2021 elections. Those are false hopes because Ugandans are not fools. They know the difference between liars and truth tellers.In fact the week Bobi Wine announced that he was going to contest against Museveni is the very week Museveni was ranked among the best presidents in the world. Two internationally respected Professors William Easterly a professor of economics at New York University and Professor Steven Pennings an economist in the world banker’s development research group, Macroeconomics and Growth team revealed in their findings that Museveni has contributed hugely for the economic development of Uganda.According to the findings of these two professors, Museveni scored highly because of the robust peace and security ushered in by his government that came to power in 1986.These findings corroborate well with reports from Uganda Bureau of Statistics that show the economic growth of the country. For example, in 1986, Uganda’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was $3.923b, but as of 2018, the country’s GDP was $27b. Also, Uganda’s life expectancy stands at 63.7 years compared to 43 years in 1986. Also, Uganda’s population has increased from 15,154,521 million people in 1986 to 40,308,000 million people to date. It is important here to note that since Museveni's government came to power, a total of 25,153,479 million people have been added on. So many factors contribute to this growth and among them is the control of infant mortality rate whereby children are now growing into adults.By last year, a total of 4,551km of roads had been tarmacked compared to 1,900km in 1986 and also access to safe and clean water has increased from 68% to 78% as of 2017.Many sub-counties are connected with electricity and rural transformation is noticed by any rightful and honest thinking Ugandan.Recent research conducted at Harvard Centre in the United States predicts that Uganda’s economy will be one of the fastest growing economies in the world by 2026 and beyond.Therefore, the Opposition should not think that serious Ugandans can allow anything that can hinder these developments and vote for them.On the contrary, Museveni is going to gain more votes than 2016 and even the youth who are the majority are going to vote for President Museveni and will comfortably win the vote.All we need to do as Museveni’s supporters is to mobilise now by explaining the achievements of NRM to the people, use the media to undo lies of the Opposition and prepare our people to vote wisely.The writer is NRM mobiliser for Bunyoro Region				googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });							googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });									googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1501674874561-0'); });					"

However, a pistol Number D4627 with 12 rounds of ammunition whose owner was also in court is on a different case.In what seem to have puzzled the defence team, Counsel Fredrick Ronald Kalule said that the submission by the two police officers was by far lacking a lot of property for his clients.These include; money, knickers, pads, wedding rings, car keys and shoes and therefore asked court to intervene and order for their return.Police accused of using phonesIn what seemed to be unsatisfactory explanation from Police about the phone’s, Shiraj Nalunga Rashida also a defence counsel told court that Police is rather playing tricks.Nalunga added that the same Police use phones of some accused persons to call their spouses, friends and issuing them with threats. She cited an example where Hon. Kyagulanyi’s phone was used to call the wife and friends.The police officers appeared in court following the court order that Arua and Gulu district CID explain that the state of the properties of the accused persons.Ronald Were the former Gulu district CID boss who did not have a lot to explain, told court that when he interacted with the accused persons, they did have their belongings after being transferred from Arua.Defence ask court to refer the caseEarlier during the start of the mention the defence team submitted that many of their clients were heavily tortured and requested the magistrate to allow some sit which request was granted.Referring the court to the Ruling of the Constitutional court on case of Dr. Kizza Besigye Vs the Attorney General of 2007, No.7, Tonny Kitara, the defence Counsel said the accused in the case was severely tortured and his rights were grossly violated but was later exonerated.Kitara who also submitted a copy of the ruling prayed to court to dismiss/discontinue the trail against all the accused persons, in the unlikely event that court does not dismiss the case, the court rather stay all the proceeding and refer to the constitutional court or court stay the proceedings in the case to give time to petition constitutional court challenge the proceedings.State rejects plea by defenceJulius Ocen the prosecutor said while it’s true citizens should claim for their rights and freedoms provided for by the constitution, it should be noted that the citizens have duties to respect the constitution.Ocen added that state organs cannot just sit and watch citizens as they go on rampage. On other note, the prosecutor told court that investigations into the matter are almost complete.He said the delay had been caused by the absence of A36 (Hon. Francis Zake the MP Mityana municipality).Police given orders, criminal summons issued       The mentioning that started at about 9:50am and concluded at 12:00pm was adjourned by Kintu to July 4, 2019. Meanwhile, defence similarly raised a prayer that court needed to discharge those accused-persons from returning to court quite often because it had become expensive for them to do so.The court issued warrant of arrest to two treason suspects, Gamaba Timusiime and Atuku Shaban because they and even their sureties were also absent without any reason given to court by defence.Kintu also promised to consult widely before coming out with a ruling on the plea made by Counsel Kitara to have the case discontinued or be referred to the constitutional court.After noting that Police had submitted sketchy documents on how they had returned some of the properties to the accused persons, the magistrate ordered Police to reappear in the next hearing with a detailed list regarding the matter.Case backgroundA total of 36 suspects are facing Treason charge after being accused of throwing stones at the Presidential motorcade in Arua municipality. This was during the climax of the Municipal MP By-election campaigns where the team of Kassiano Wadri clashed with that of the President in the evening.				googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });							googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });									googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1501674874561-0'); });					"
        Added 1st May 2019 06:23 PM       ,"Bobi Wine our freedom fighter, be hard like Stella Nyanzi, don’t leave prison","						 Michael Woira					Unfortunately we have a few good minded people joining leadership, politics is now for the wordy people, those who can make the loudest noise and those who can compose radical songs that are against the current leadership			googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1496656157133-0'); });		By Michael WoiraThere are several ways of serving fellow Ugandans in a more public and personal way than running for office. Politicians often put themselves on display for criticism, compliment, and everything in between. Certainly, everyone does it with their own intentions and bear in mind what they feel like achieving, many of them become candidates of getting sympathy to access various opportunities, others join politics just because they see it as the only avenue to becoming rich easily and others just do it because they see it as the most comfortable job that needs little or no supervision from the voters.The basics of running for office in Uganda is mainly making sure you have time, you have people who support you and money is also one of the requirements you must have to contest and be part of the elections. If you don’t have enough of any of those, chances are good you’ll lose. The important thing for you to remember if you’re deciding to join politics is to know that you are in this virtually alone.That aside, democracy has really granted politicians a right to act properly and improperly depending on their motives but in Uganda’s case politicians use it to cause fears on the people and this is because there is a lot of freedom of speech, freedom of Movement and a lot more of democracy that restrictions on some rights that people are misusing.I have seen all kinds of political drama happening in this country since I was young up to date. I remember the big untouchable politicians of those days like Kiiza Besigye, Alhajji Sebagala, I even remember the time when the famous Hajji alagide song was the only famous song and several slogans were printed and posted everywhere in praise of Besigye and Sebagala. Leave alone Kyarenga and Tuliyambala engule that have not captured a serious Airwave and masses, Hajji Alagide was the real deal everywhere and we also used to sing to the tune while we were young in our primary school.With our current politics and kind of politicians, you can easily mistake parliament for comedy store since almost half of the arguments are based on anger, hearsay, politicking, and too much noise. Sometimes I feel sorry for the speaker of parliament because it is very easy managing baby class pupils than managing the parliament of adults because kids can listen to the teacher attentively but some members of parliament at times don’t even know the rules of procedure in parliament so they even keep shouting even when the speaker puts them to order.To me, I think amateurism can refresh politics and if we have ethical politicians then we can have a very friendly peaceful political environment but it’s the opposite here in Uganda, people even decide to exchange brawls in parliament and their electorates praise them for fighting in the house, people break parliamentary items and they just walk away freely?Ohh my dear country Uganda, anyway we need as many people to join politics, but unfortunately we have a few good minded people joining leadership, politics is now for the wordy people, those who can make the loudest noise and those who can compose radical songs that are against the current leadership, politics here is now for the most famous, those with a lot of money in the villages where we stay, it’s for those that disrespect government, those who can abuse the president while appearing on a TV or radio talk shows, those that can stand firm and exchange brawls with security agencies, those that can command demonstrations.It is no longer about the quality of leaders, it is now about the number of leaders representing which political formation but all this will be overcome as time goes on.Now to the freedom fighter that we have here in Uganda, Bobi Wine, he has become the king of the jungle, he is now the fat bull in the kraal, he acts the way he wants, he uses the nastiest language while referring to the president of the country, he calls him names and he does all this in the name of looking for sympathy from his followers who also consider that as right.Fine, you wanted to go and make a statement at the CID headquarters but was it necessary to advertise and mobilise people to follow you yet you very well know about the Public Order Management Bill, wish you know how people lose their properties and merchandise during such demonstrations you couldn’t be doing such over and over but I am very sure you don’t really know all that happens because for your case you just wave to them as you are sailing in your expensive donor-funded cars.Anyway, since you are our own, just follow the footsteps of our other freedom fighter Stella Nyanzi and make a similar decision of not leaving prison for at least one year or five months minimum so we believe you are more of a freedom fighter than Nyanzi a female who has been there for long. During your year in Luzira, you will be back and for sure the peace we will have everyone will just appreciate you for your absence in our communities.The writer is a Pan Africanist 				googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1496657157715-0'); });							googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });							googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });									googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1501674874561-0'); });					"

He is to return to court on May 23.			googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1496656157133-0'); });		COURTKAMPALA - Buganda Road Chief Magistrates Court has granted Kyadondo East MP Robert Kyagulanyi (Bobi Wine) sh1m cash bail, and each of his three sureties bonded sh10m not cash in Kampala.Kyagulanyi was at the beginning of this week remanded to Luzira Prison after being charged with disobedience of statutory duty.The charge sheet tendered before the court showed that the musician-turned-politician faces charges of offences he allegedly committed last year. He is said to have held a public meeting without giving notice to any authorized officer or Police.Following his successful bail application on Thursday shortly after 2 pm local time, Grade One magistrate Esther Nahirya barred the MP from engaging in any unlawful demonstration. He is expected to report back to court on May 23 - three weeks from today - for trial. Kyagulanyi's supporters celebrated his successful bail application Earlier on Thursday, the court went into a one-hour break after the defence team presented their client's bail application to the court, alongside three sureties - plus arguments for bail. The prosecution side was also given an opportunity to present their arguments against bail for the legislator.Kyagulanyi, the accused, followed proceedings remotely from Luzira Prison via the recently-introduced video conferencing system. Standing in a prison court dock, flanked by two prison officers, throughout the session, he became the first suspect ever to appear before the court from Luzira via video conferencing.Chief Justice Bart Katureebe commissioned the virtual courts mid-last month, where inmates and witnesses off-site can attend court remotely.The system can connect magistrates to Luzira prison's virtual courts fitted at the male and women's wings using video conferencing facilities. After about three hours of proceedings, the magistrate decided to stand over the session briefly to allow her time to prepare the judgement on the bail application.An hour later, she would make the highly-anticipated pronouncement, which sent Kyagulanyi's supporters into celebrations and chanting inside the courtroom.The state attorney arguing against bail for Kyagulanyi Before the verdict delivery,  the state argued that the court needed to ""strike a balance between the individual rights of the applicant and the rights of society at large"".""The balance can only be well-struck by maintaining the applicant in safe lawful detention facilities, like where [Luzira Prison] he is at,"" said the state attorney.""In doing so, the accused's rights of safety will be maintained along with the rights of other members of society.""In response, the defence side submitted that "" the right to liberty of an individual is a fundamental right"" and is ""next only to the individual's right to life"".For his bail application, Kyagulanyi presented MPs Patrick Nsamba (Kassanda North), Gaffa Mbwatekamwa (Kasambya County) and former ethics and integrity minister Miria Matembe to stand surety for him.The prosecution side punched holes in the trio. Kyagulanyi's three sureties: From left, Mbwatekamwa (red beret), Matembe and Nsamba in court The accused followed proceedings remotely via video conferencingTo begin with, the state attorney said that at 64, Matembe, a former member of the Pan-African Parliament, is of advanced age and is ""not visibly capable to compel the applicant to adhere to the orders of the court"".And about the other sureties: ""The two are co-equals of the accused person and do not have any legitimate authority over the applicant"".The state attorney argued further: ""For a person to qualify as a substantial surety, consideration is not merely based on status or prestige. The sole consideration is that the surety should be capable of compelling the accused person to appear in court. It is my submission that the sureties presented can only merely request the applicant to report to the court, which request can be ignored.""On the place of abode condition, the prosecution argued that considering that Kyagulanyi lives in Magere, Wakiso district, the Buganda Road Chief Magistrates Court has no jurisdiction over his place of residence.But while all the sureties present also reside ""way outside"" the jurisdiction of the court, ""the law does not require the sureties to have a place of abode within the court's jurisdiction - unlike the applicant "", the prosecution added.The defence team's Samuel Muyizi Mulindwa said: ""The test to be applied is a qualitative test - and this court can take judicial notice that the sureties have well-known public known residences.""Defence lead counsel Asuman Basalirwa substantiality has no relation with age ""They [sureties] have a clear public nexus and private bond with the accused person,"" said lead defence counsel Asuman Basalirwa.""Substantiality has no relation with age. One of them [Matembe] is a neighbour and the other two are MPs who are always in Parliament with him.  They have influence over him. Bail must not be hinged on financial ability,"" he said.On the state's recommendations that if the accused is to be granted bail, it should be sh10m and cash, Basalirwa claimed that their client, is also a musician, had several of his concerts cancelled on the orders of the state.He was also critical of the video conferencing system used to conduct the bail application hearing, saying that ""if it was not for the liberty of our client"", they would not have submitted to the use of this mode for the application.The lawyer called it an ""ambush"", saying they were ""not able to consult with our client"". When offered a chance by the magistrate to speak, cautioning him to ""refresh from political phrases"", Kyagulanyi said: ""My business is standing for the truth. My business is standing for what is morally right"".""If standing for what is right will get me out of here, then I will thank God. And if standing for what is right will keep me in prison, then I will thank God even more,"" he said before the break in the buildup to the verdict delivery.Reaction inside court after Kyagulanyi's successful bail application Also related to this storyBobi Wine back in court via video conferencingIGG raises skepticism over court video conferencing				googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1496657157715-0'); });							googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });							googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });									googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1501674874561-0'); });					"

Those notices must be sent on time. At times when the writers do not get feedback, it means it was sent late, or it was written wrongly,” she noted.Namaye said all players must ensure they follow the set guidelines. “Not FDC alone but all those holding political activities must follow the set guidelines,” she said.UPC also called on the Electoral Commission (EC) and Uganda Human Rights Commission (UHRC) to kick start early civic and voter education to guide voters as the country prepares for the 2021 general elections.“Some MPs splash money on the day preceding the voting. They take advantage of the prevailing poverty situation among the voters and change their minds at the last minute,” Osinde noted.He noted that lack of civic and voter education is the main reason why the country continues to face massive voter bribery, high rate of invalid votes, apathy, low voter turnout, political intolerance and political radicalism among others.He said this leads to having a national Parliament and districts full of incompetent leaders. 				googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });							googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });									googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1501674874561-0'); });					"

He also named co-ordinators for the youth, women, persons with disabilities, academic institutions and the entertainment industry.At the function, People Power spokesperson Joel Ssenyonyi said besides the regional co-ordinators, there will also be those from districts, parishes and villages.The co-ordinators will be accountable to a leadership council headed by Kyagulanyi.DP a no showUnlike previous People Power events, this time the top leaders of the Democratic Party (DP) bloc, including Norbert Mao, Michael Mabikke, Abed Bwanika and Samuel Makaku were conspicuously absent.Also, leaders of the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC), Uganda People’s Congress (UPC) and Alliance for National Transformation were absent. At the same event, Kyagulanyi declared his intention to run for the presidency in the 2021 general elections.There have been media reports that Kyagulanyi had agreed to back former FDC president Dr. Kizza Besigye during the forthcoming elections. But with his declaration yesterday, it appears an alliance between Kyagulanyi and Besigye for a single candidate is unlikely.Kyagulanyi’s strategyKyagulanyi said part of his plan is to empower institutions to make them independent. “Instead of big institutions, in Uganda, we have a big personality, something People Power wants to rectify by returning this power to the people, empowering and strengthening institutions so that they can deliver to the people of Uganda,” he argued.People Power has largely entrusted legislators to head the teams in the regions.There are National Resistance Movement (NRM), DP, FDC, JEEMA and independents legislators who have taken up positions in the People Power.They include Kassiano Wadri (Independent), Lucy Akello (FDC), Mbwatekamwa Gaffa (NRM), Barnabas Tinkasimire (NRM), John Baptist Nambeshe (NRM), Asuman Basalirwa (JEEMA), Agnes Nabulindo and Winnie Kiiza (FDC).Others are Robert Centenary (FDC) Medard Ssegona (DP), Latif Ssebaggala, Lutamaguzi Ssemakula (DP), Angelline Osegge (FDC), David Kalwanga Lukyamuzi (IND), Muwanga Kivumbi (DP), Mathias Mpuuga (DP) and Francis Zaake, among others.However, MP Bildad Moses Adome (NRM), named as head of the People Power team for Karamoja region, distanced himself from the group, saying he was not consulted.In an interview with New Vision, Adome said he had seen the reports, but his appointment was “a presumption by the People Power group that whoever voted against the Age Limit is for them.“This is not true to some of us,” he said, adding that naming him among co-ordinators could jeopardise his roles as an MP from NRM. “I will request to know what exactly the People Power stands for, what they would wish me to do and what they expect me to do and how it may be of help to the people I lead. Short of the above, I won’t be fooled to accept what I don’t see light in,” Adome added.Internal power struggle According to sources, the naming of co-ordinators came amid a fierce power struggle within People Power.Sources said the lineup confirmed a growing rift between Kyagulanyi, and the DP bloc leaders.They added that some of the DP bloc leaders felt sidelined by Kyagulanyi especially when he named Ssenyonyi as spokesperson without consulting them, and when he held a meeting with Besigye behind their back.Ssenyonyi denied any power struggle, saying the DP bloc and People Power are distinct entities.“DP bloc conduct their own activities. We do the same and only notify each other of any developments,” he said.About the absence of key DP leaders from the event, Ssenyonyi said they only invited co-ordinators, although other people turned up as well-wishers.“That is why DP bloc leaders, who are also People Power co-ordinators, such as Dr. Lulume Bayiga, were present at the press conference, it was not for everyone. Even the party leaders were just notified,” Ssenyonyi explained.Contacted for a comment on the development, Mukaku said naming the co-ordinators is a step in the right direction.“Kyagulanyi has presidential ambitions and it is good to get people to help him pursue that ambition. I had not seen the list of the co-ordinators before it was unveiled, so to fully accept it, I have to go through it and discuss it with Hon. Kyagulanyi,” he added.DP vice-president Denis Mukasa Mbidde also welcomed the development.“It is now clearer, engagements and strategies are more directed than it was before. They can now identify opponents and allies. I am the vice-president of DP and I can’t be a regional co-ordinator, it is so minor, but of course, I am part of People Power. I have heard about the power struggle, but I am still investigating the allegations,” he explained.Meanwhile, the Alliance for National Transformation (ANT) leader Maj. Gen Mugisha Muntu urged ANT members not to be engaged in “controversies over instances where there are colleagues who cut across the Alliance and People Power.”The teamWEST NILEHon Kasiano Wadri (Team Leader)Hon James AcidriHon Oguzu LeeHabib AsegaManeno AvakoACHOLIHon Lucy Akello (Team Leader)Hon Gilbert OlanyaOlenga AnthonyOkema SantosKARAMOJAHon Adome Bildard (Team Leader)Ayen Arnest LopoloMukuluPonyu BadruLANGOHon Jonathan Odur (Team Leader)Moses Okot P’BitekOkello BlickIsaac OkaeTESOHon Susan Amero (Team Leader)Angelina OsegeHerbert ArikoOjangone AnthonyGeorge OkoitTOOROInnocent Natukunda (Team Leader)Kakuru ThomasHanifa SaidNyakato HassanDoreen KaijaANKOLEHon Mbwatekamwa Gaffa (Team Leader)Kakama MosesLucas MuhangiMuhanguzi KateeraLubega MuzamirNabasa RonaldKIGEZIAyebare JasperDaniel MusheruraRhoda TuhimbiseGodfrey ByamuikamaEmmanuel SebiriSEBEIPastor Mathew Santid (Team Leader)Chemonges Benjamin KwoyenChemisto KubaiBUNYOROHon.

He has been not just active letting his followers know what he has been up to, but also engages a lot,” Wanyama said.“You have seen him respond to specific tweets and give feedback to his followers. He is a leader who keeps up with the times.”Comparing Museveni with his political competitors, Kyadondo East’s Robert Kyagulanyi, also known as Bobi Wine has 264,000 and is over 700,000 followers short of Museveni whereas opposition and FDC strongman, Dr.Kizza Besigye at 354,000 is over 640,000 followers shy of Museveni’s new milestone.				googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1496657157715-0'); });							googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });							googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });									googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1501674874561-0'); });					"

These were South Africa, Ethiopia, Libya, Morocco and Zimbabwe. Early this year, DRC experience change of leadership while Sudan is experiencing demonstrations in the capital, Khartoum.Between1990 to 1994, 29 countries in Africa conducted elections under multiparty democracy and in 13 countries out of the 29, incumbent presidents lost the elections. These were Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe, Benin, Zambia, Mali, Congo Brazzaville, Madagascar, Niger, Lesotho, Burundi, Central African Republic, South Africa and Sierra Leone.Before the introduction of multiparty democracy, political changes in Africa used to be violent and bloody. This was because of two major factors:			googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611604321-0'); });					googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611604321-0'); });		a). the colonial legacy that put tribes and religion against each other amidst the fundamentals of chiefdoms.				googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1501674790852-0'); });			b). the struggle by the external powers over supremacy, resource exploitation and continuous control of African states even after independence.Between 1960-1990, Africa had 64 successful coup d’état and 114 attempts and during the same period, 23 presidents and prime ministers were assassinated while 44 states had experienced a coup or attempted a coup.Therefore, it is worth noting that the affairs of the state are not things to play games with. Bobi Wine seems to be excited without reflecting on the wider question of national stability. Those that keep encouraging him without proper mentoring/guidance are like parents encouraging a child to play with fire near a grass thatched hut when they are inside the hut.For those calling for change (transition from President Museveni to another), we have to remember that a skilful statesman like President Yoweri Museveni would notwish to see this country slide into what we experienced in the past. Before we call for the transition of leadership from above, we need to understand that transition can take place from the middle, bottom or we can have a system transition. We are missing key ingredients of change because we have put the focus on one person, the president and yet even if we change the president, the other levels of change and system would remain the same. Unless the Bobi Wine group are talking about changing a constitutional order whereby elections would mean nothing even if the NRM sponsors President Museveni to run in 2021.We have witnessed struggling/failed transition in the Arab springs where countries like Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Syria, Bahrain, Morocco, Iraq, Algeria etc fell victims of externally driven transition that have left these countries in ruin. We have witnessed sustained street demonstrations in Morocco, Iraq, Algeria, Iranian Khuzestan, Lebanon, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman and Sudan. The wave of these protests faded by mid-2012 and large scale conflicts followed and resulted in the Syrian civil war, Iraq insurgency, Egyptian crisis, the Libyan and Yemen crisis. In short, the whole of North Africa is in crisis up to date.The illusions that these popular demonstrations would end corruption, increase political participation and bring about greater economic equality collapsed because instability that they were experiencing is due to such misguided demonstrations could not allow these countries to be stable.As of February 2018, only the uprising in Tunisia had resulted in a transition of democratic governance. In sub-Saharan Africa, the following countries are managing struggling transition; Nigeria, South Sudan, Somalia, DRC, Zimbabwe, Ethiopia.Congo Brazzaville, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea and Kenya are struggling to balance family rules whereas Tanzania, Namibia, Botswana, Ghana, Angola, Liberia, Zambia, Senegal and South Africa have, to some extent, controlled the after effect of a change from one political party to another or from one leader to another.The NRM Government has been a good student of all the above and it stated managing transition right from the time it restored constitutional order in the country that gave back power to the people by empowering the previously marginalised members of our society (Youth, Women, PWDs), conducting regular free and fair elections, granting the independence of the Judiciary and Parliament and encouraging the principles of functioning multi-party democracy. Our philosophy in managing political change is that we galvanise all available human resources and allow Ugandans to make a choice.As we skilfully guide the community, the management of peace and stability is one of our core vocations, managing the economy, managing expectations/excitement, managing foreign interference in our economy and democracy, managing the geopolitics and geo-economic situations as we skilfully utilise our limited resources.In all these, we are safeguarding human rights and the rule of law as we nurture Uganda into the maturity of tolerance and coexistence regardless of our social, political and economic situation.These are the reasons why Ugandans trust the leadership of President Museveni and the NRM Government more.Writer is the deputy secretary general of the National Resistance Movement				googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });							googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });									googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1501674874561-0'); });					"

Mugisha Muntu of the Alliance for National Transformation (ANT) has spoken out on how they have survived the disruption of their political activities by the Police.Muntu noted that ANT has been engaged in low key activities, which don’t seem to attract the attention of the Police to step in.His remarks come at the time when the Police and other security agencies have been blocking key Opposition political parties from organising rallies, music shows and even taking part in the radio talk shows across the country.He noted that he has held a number of meetings in small towns and at parish levels in over 15 sub-regions, which have been effective in recruiting genuine party supporters than even through holding huge rallies.“The meetings have helped us to get in touch with the real people who matter,” Muntu said.He made the remarks on Friday during an interactive meeting with the editors and journalists of the different media houses in Uganda held at Karveli Hotel in Kampala. Muntu met the editors to brief them about the activities and achievements of the ANT ahead of its launch on May 22.He said ANT has got a different approach to politics that believes in creating powerful institutions at the expense of building strong individuals.Muntu promised to work with the media to help them in ensuring that the journalists’ rights are guarded against the government’s excesses.In Uganda’s politics, Muntu is considered to be a uniting factor by both the Opposition and those in the ruling NRM.On the disruption of the activities of the Opposition political parties by Police and other security organs, Muntu said the government fears crowds because they change perceptions.The General also supported the deal struck recently by People Power led by Kyadondo East MP, Robert Kyagulanyi aka Bobi Wine and the People’s Government of Col. Kizza Besigye, saying that it will bring about peace in the Opposition.Before striking the deal last week, supporters of Kyagukanyi and Besigye would attack one another on social media.

The government should come here and address what steps it has taken to improve our media freedom rankings and also prevail over its employees over these directives,” Ssemujju said. Baryomunsi, however, supported UCC for the directive saying Parliament should hail the institution for doing what it is supposed to do.				googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1496657157715-0'); });							googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });							googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });									googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1501674874561-0'); });					"

He is also a businessman, the brains behind Brand Active, an advertising and promotions company.Ritah Mukasa caught up with him on his love life, career and passion for music;At what point in your life did you fall in love with music?Music has always been my hobby, which is why I have been singing since childhood. In fact, I remember sharing a stage with celebrities like Juliana and Chameleon in the early 2000s. However, I quit shortly and moved into business because there was no money then in the music industry. The story is different today. It was a few years ago when I realized that I had nudged what I really love. I am back with an album dubbed ‘Done waiting’ that comprises love and soul healing hits. 			googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611395617-0'); });					googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611395617-0'); });		Are you back to earn from music?For now, I am not prioritizing music as a career or profession but a hobby. Just like one goes to the gym or golf club, I head to the studio.Down memory lane, almost 15 years ago, when I left the defunct WBS Television, CTV and KFM, I had to make ends meet.I just got a wake-up call recently that the clock was ticking and the only passion I had was tucked away in a cold cob-web box. I told myself, now is the time, so I went to the studio last year.Do you write your music?I really love music. I sing from the heart but honestly, I haven’t written the songs. These are stories from awesome songwriters.I look for the best songwriters. The music, therefore, could be their own experiences. I just translate the emotions into voice.I have worked with Tusker Project Fame Winner, Esther Nabaasa, Ray Signature, Yese Oman Rafiki, Smart Keys, Doctor Brain and a few others who I will disclose once the current projects are out of the studio.Given your tight schedules, where do you get time for music? Just like anyone finds time for an evening jog, I walk into the studio because music is a hobby to me.I also practice late night in my home studio. On a scale of 1-10, my passion is at three for now but hope to make it move to five. I am not into this as a commercial artist.‘We just want love’ has amazing lyrics and the video was on point, how did you pull this off? This was a perfect collaboration with Esther Nabaasa and production guru Michael Fingaz.With a good sound from the duo, I had to hire Sasha Vybze for the video; my best in the industry.Meanwhile, I appreciate that my songs are doing well on Ugandan airwaves, so, you should expect more of this. 16 track album is out and videos for most of the songs are in the works.  Who wrote your latest hit?This remains under wraps! But I just did three songs with six different producers last week. These will be on my second album.  Where do you see yourself in five years?  I am honestly not looking that far in the future yet. Right now, I just want to do good music and hopefully have the world accept it. Whatever opportunities that come along, we shall weigh them. What is your other self away from music?  I have a success story. God has blessed me with a beautiful family. I am a father of three amazing angels. Their mum is beautiful as well. I am also thankful for my good business, Brand Active. Besides, I have seen it all; driven good cars and built mansions among other things. I not looking for more than that. I am content. We see celebrated musicians turning to politics.  What is your take on this? Well, music comes with fame. And fame comes with numbers. Numbers seem to convince many that they can win an election. So, for the politics inclined musician, I guess they jump onto this. Personally, I would never take that route. Family, music and business is all I am into Can Bobi Wine become president? No comment.  Who is your Ugandan female celebrity crush? Musically, I usually look at vocal delivery and to me, Rema Namakula has no competitor.  What is your weakest point in life? I get bored easily which is why I don’t immerse myself too long into situations. So, a few might find me a little detached. Do you think the industry will remain relevant without icons; Chameleon, Bebe Cool and Bobi Wine who have joined politics? There is an amazing pool of talent from singers, songwriters, and producers. Music is destined to be a big industry with or without the three legends. But my prayer is that they never hang up the mic! They are so talented."

( Photo by Edna Piyic) The defence lawyer, Medard Ssegona read the documents that were tendered by prosecution.They are a statement of a police officer, Alfred Okello who reported the case on August 15, a statement of Herbert Wanyoto, the regional crime officer, West Nile which was recorded on August 18.Other statements were of a police officer, Richard Olony and a statement from a medical officer of Arua Regional Referral Hospital on  August 24, last year and a lock up register and exhibit slips.Ssegona asked court to ensure that prosecution certifies the documents like the statements and exhibit slips.“We find it pertinent to pray for further disclosure of the station diary and exhibits that is when we will consider disclosure closed,” he said.He said prosecution should not tender other documents afterwards because they do not seek to be ambushed with new documents.Ssegona said after tendering all the documents in time they will then proceed for the hearing of the case.“We are prepared for this trail more than ever before to employ the entire machinery to acquire justice,”he said.He said they are hopeful that at the end of the trial, they will be a difference between prosecution and persecution.“Our contention is that our client  is being persecuted for political reasons, “the people  who should be arraigned  in court for the gruesome murder of  Yassin Kawuma, Bobi Wine’s driver have never been brought to book and they are in charge of the state,” Ssegona said.The state prosecutor William Bayo says some documents were not certified because certification is a duty of Police.He however requested for more time for certification of the documents so that the hearing process can start.He said they are prepared for the case and will not ambush defence but asked court for an adjournment.The grade one court magistrate, Arua, Swaleh Asiku asked prosecution to avail all the necessary documents to prevent scenarios of tendering documents when the trial starts.“I am giving prosecution by the end of Friday to tender in all the documents to prevent ambushes and if that is not possible then by 29th of this month they should have availed the documents that will help in the trial,” he said.He adjourned the case to  April 25, 2019.				googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });							googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });									googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1501674874561-0'); });					"

It is the face of Uganda and centre of influence, comprising 10 million people.			googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1496656157133-0'); });		Former security minister Lt Gen (rtd) Henry Tumukunde, is said to be aspiring for the Kampala Lord Mayor’s seat in 2021. UMARU KASHAKA interviewed him on a wide range of issues, including his alleged fights with the former Inspector General of Police (IGP), Gen. Kale Kayihura and President Yoweri Museveni succession.So, how far have you gone with your plans to unseat Erias Lukwago? I am consulting. I do not storm into decisions; I am a mathematical dealer. I want to check whether I can play very well here (as Lord Mayor), how many prejudices are against me and how received am I. Fortunately, I am very well received because of my history.Having served in the military, do you feel fulfilled? Yes, because whenever I was given opportunity, I performed to my best. I have served the government for an average of 13-15 years and in that period, I made a mark.Apart from ending bomb blasts in Kampala in the late 1990s, what else would you consider your biggest achievement? I brought an end to (Lord’s Resistance Army leader) Joseph Kony. I went to northern Uganda as a division commander and my first investigation was how Kony feeds. I noticed that he was getting this food from IDPs (internally displaced persons). So, we sealed it (IDP camp) off. That is when he fled to northern Uganda. So, I was effective as a commander.Why are you mobilising in Kampala? I am mobilising voters to change the leadership in Kampala. Kampala is an important sub-area of Uganda. It is the face of Uganda and centre of influence, comprising 10 million people.So, I will never be hanged for not trying to try. When you change Kampala, you will largely change Uganda.What is your plan for Kampala? Kampala is a national problem. It contributes to the economy in volumes and so, it should get something in equal value. But Kampala and its residents need to be organised. If you go to Katanga (one of Kampala’s biggest slums) you will find three toilets which are closed at 7:00 pm; so, what happens after that? Can you apply timers on human beings? But a mayor in himself may not solve all these, neither can the resources allocated to Kampala. So that is why I am patiently consulting. I will decide according to what I find on the ground.But you were up there as a minister. Aren’t you stooping low to compete for a mayoral seat, which is largely ceremonial?But why should the Lord Mayor’s seat be ceremonial? The laws that made it ceremonial can make it substantive. Are we too late to amend the laws? No! We are going to contribute our views (to the KCCA Bill). Why should Kampala’s mayor be necessarily excluded from the rest of the mayorships when it is the most important city? And in any case, if votes decide politics, why should one voted power freeze another voted officer?How do you expect to win in Kampala which is an opposition stronghold? Haven’t you seen the Opposition voting a person on individual merit? Ugandans are capable of checking whether things are working in their favour or not. People know what they want, and time will tell. But it is also whether people get to understand that you understand their problems. There are 64 slums in Kampala. Schools are submerged in Bwaise! Can’t the leaders, for example, break or sort out the problem? The Netherlands is below sea level; so why should Bwaise be complicated mathematics? You can either relocate people or drain Bwaise.I hope you know that Lukwago is still a force to reckon with.But why would I want to contest with somebody who is not a force to reckon with?Many people wondered why the President sacked you as security minister? You are asking the wrong person; President Museveni should give you the answer. But in all fairness, I am honoured to be so favoured by the public; if an appointing authority thinks you have come to an end, then he ceases to appoint you. The bigger point is sometimes working to appoint yourself because political jobs are wide and open. You do not have to entirely depend on the mercy of appointments. Were you sacked because of your clashes with Kayihura?Kayihura was an IGP, I was a minister. There was no direct link between us. Secondly, in politics, the playground is not very plain. There are some organised forces whose main intention is to crush some players. So, if you are not careful enough, you will always be consumed into what are imaginary differences.Gen. Kayihura did a good job as far as I am concerned. When you meet a Police Officer on the streets, he is excited and full of confidence. And that had always been my prayer. So, Kayihura deserves to be credited for that. However, his time was also associated with predominant lawlessness because we incorporated people who were not qualified into the system of managing law and order. We have always depended on the population to gather intelligence, but we have always been careful not to incorporate them in the solutions of intelligence.People say you were given a mission as security minister to finish off Kayihura. Are you saying I am useable? That I was used and discarded? That presumes that I am some useable material for President Museveni. That he uses me when he wishes and drops me when he wishes and that I am always very happy about it or that I work with him under that table. That is a gazetted joke. It minimises my individual capacity. I am largely capable and competent and, therefore, may not be good material for usability.People have dragged in the issue of Rwanda in your clashes with Kayihura The Rwandans have their country; we have ours. My job was to defend Uganda. Let me say this without mincing words: anyone operating in this country must respect our institutions, our leadership and our country.And this, for me, is very fundamental. Ugandans are now respected; I do not want us to return to the days when people were putting us aside at international airports just because we carried a Ugandan passport. We progressed and we must protect our progress. So, anyone playing here must do it with absolute respect of our institutions, systems and leadership.People say you clashed with Kayihura over his huge budget vis-à-vis what you were allocated Do ministers handle budgets? No! That should have been Col. Kaka Bagyenda’s (Internal Security Organisation director-general) or Joseph Ocwet’s (director-general External Security Organisation) business. In every institution, there is an accounting officer. I was just a policy manager as a minister. You tend to spend a lot of your energies on generals. There is a Uganda of tomorrow.What is the Uganda of tomorrow? For example, in 2021, 4.3 million Ugandans will vote for the first time after clocking 18. How will you manage them? How will you provide them with jobs? How will you take care of their expectations? And how long are we going to continue exporting raw coffee or raw tea? Or continue to depend on the hoe for production when Malaysians hanged it in 1972? We were richer than Singapore and South Korea, but they are now far ahead of us.			googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611395617-0'); });					googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611395617-0'); });		So, how do we tap into human capital? Look at health services; do you know we have so many doctors in South Africa? Why don’t you bring them here? Where is their soft landing? Do you want to continue paying millions going to India? How long are we going to go like this? Importing everything — a safety pin, needle, thread.Wonderful ideas! You need to be reappointed! Why doesn’t the President see this? The political space is wide open. It is a question of whether I can fit myself in. I am healthy and available. But why are you limited to being appointed? Museveni has not been appointed for a very long time. The Lord Mayor of Kampala is not appointed. He is elected. The MPs are not appointed.How do you look at Uganda’s future? You should stop being overdependent on President Museveni. You should also stop being overcritical. What are you doing for your country? How much time do you spend thinking about your country?You keep campaigning for President Museveni; why don’t you allow him to retire? President Museveni will not retire himself; it is the voters who will retire him. So, if you have issues with how he has served for so long, participate in your country’s politics and speak for change. That is your privilege. You should also participate in elections and mobilise the voters for change. So, when everybody is sitting and the only active man is President Museveni, you want to tell me he will retire himself?How do you expect to win in Kampala when you failed in your own home district, Rukungiri, to garner enough support for President Museveni to defeat Dr Kizza Besigye there in 2016 elections?Who told you garnering support for the President is equal to garnering support for yourself? But it is also about how you manage some of these elections. I am very sure Rukungiri can vote me, either in the municipality or Rubabo.What is your take on Kyadondo East MP Bobi Wine’s presidential bid? Bobi Wine is an up-and-coming politician. He has occupied space most of you fear to occupy. He also raises crowds. But I want to ask: Is Uganda so easy to manage? Who of the leaders offering themselves have the competence to manage it? However, this should not stop or thwart up and- coming leaders. Bobi Wine is an up-and-coming leader; so was Museveni in 1981.Is he a threat to Museveni? Well, the voting box will tell us. The natural process of selecting leadership is simply at play. Like it is in Kampala: me, Lukwago and Jose Chameleone can offer ourselves and Ugandans decide.			googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611604321-0'); });					googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611604321-0'); });						googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1501674790852-0'); });			Your colleagues in NRM dismiss Besigye as a power-hungry attention seeker?

The whole of Europe, Latin America and Americas have populism as the major threat to democracy.			googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611395617-0'); });					googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611395617-0'); });		With Africa, considering our fragile democracies, most of which are in formative stages-our political actors should be put on notice: populism is slowly trying to redefine the operations of state mechanics for the worse. We have witnessed populism firing up uprisings in Libya, Egypt, Tunisia and Madagascar.Liberation theology is being rewritten as we witness crumbling of main stream liberation movements more so in Tanzania (CCM) and South Africa (ANC). South Africa for example is stuck in populism tumult fronted by a former ANC youth leader, the Julius Malema, President of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Party.Malema is promising Animal Farm like sugar-candy mountains, riding on black empowerment-a travesty that can only destroy South Africa. Like I have urged several times, the political opposition especially in Africa lack ideological anchorage, thence resorting to demonizing personalities in leadership, this now is being augmented by blind populism. It can only be dangerous.Listening to the ‘Tuliyambala Engule’ song, one clearly understands the real foundation of our opposition politics. ‘Tuliyambala Engule’ can literally be interpreted to mean-an era where all will be perfect, happiness, no toil, no stress but jubilation. The copycat song outlines the challenges facing Uganda but directly blaming all these to the current leadership.			googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611604321-0'); });					googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611604321-0'); });		Laughable, but to a socio-economically challenged educated youths, this can be ignition for blind political activism. It is easy to convince unemployed youths that the long stay of Museveni is the cause of their suffering.				googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1501674790852-0'); });			These youths may not ask themselves what happened to Uganda that changed top leadership more frequently than any other independent African country.Before Museveni, our Uganda witnessed more than six government changes-every new government would promise a better Uganda – ‘Okwambala Engule’ (putting on a crown) but what we saw was Uganda being pushed into even deeper political and economic crisis. Our history is so recent for all to refer to.How I wish our youths who are the target of this fantasy would ask our good ‘Tulyambala Engule’ crusader these questions. How do you intend to fight corruption in Uganda? I would start with himself as an example and ask: assuming you are the next President - can you clearly demonstrate how we can trust you to be our messiah and moral compass, given your history which we know very well.I would continue: when did you stop to joy in the troubles of people you do not agree with/your enemies, where I will remind the honourable crusader when he composed a song in praise of the errant security guard who shot and injured his arch rival Beebe cool.How am I supposed to entrust such a sadist with the responsibility of a Commander in Chief?I would continue my bother to the crusader: you have had a very successful musical career-you own a lot of property, including emperor like residences, can you tell us who among your colleagues, especially those you sing with-backups, instrumental players, dancers who have equally benefitted from your fat pay cheques so that we may be able to confirm that when you are president all of us shall equally benefit from your crown (engule).I will continue to inform: Are you aware Mr. Crusader that you are not the first successful musicians in Uganda? Why do you think other equally or better musicians in the days before Museveni’s rule died paupers? Don’t you think your success, as you repeatedly tell us, from the ghetto to one of the richest persons in Uganda, suggest that Uganda is a country where hard work and talent pays irrespective of somebody’s political affiliation?Of course since he is an honorable, I will be polite not to remind him about how his gangerstars had made night clubs a nightmare in Uganda via their numerous fights with “rival groups”.I would continue: Sir, tell us your philosophy of sharing the national resources. We have a known resource envelop and our problems are known. Let us assume you have fought corruption by employing your Angelic team: Kabbaaya, Mutwe etc. (I mention the two because, I think these are the most known loyal colleagues of our ‘Tuliyambala Engule’ crusader).Tell us how you will grow this economy to make everybody happy given the resources at our disposal-can we look at your proposed figures. At this point, I may remind him that in Africa examples abound where the likes of him who thought that the overstay of certain leaders was the cause of misery.In countries like Malawi (Kamuzu Banda), Zambia (Keneth Kaunda), Egypt (Housin Mubarak), Libya (Gaddafi) and DRC (Mobutu) removal of long serving leaders (much as most of these were super dictators) only served to push these countries into deeper political and economic crisis.Possibly our chief crusader can tell us what is happening in these countries after removing the so called overstayed leaders so that we can confirm the hypothesis that removal of a seemingly overstayed leader leads to a country’s growth and prosperity.Lacking originality and riding on street emotions, ‘Tuliyambala Engule’ song is a perfect representation of our opposition. You will never hear them talk about serious policy alternatives other than riding on the challenges of the time facing government.When there happen to be some unexplained homicide - our typical opposition will jump on that with all sorts of conspiracy theories and the next day when there is a school fire our good friends will make this to sound like its government that has burnt the school.I have followed our opposition since the 1996 elections, you rarely hear them talking policy and how to solve the problems afflicting our people.On this, Museveni and his team are politically lonely - prescribing a host of strategic approaches to solve our problems and the opposition always at the receiving end to oppose without giving any policy alternatives.As a result the opposition has created the wrong impression that –“remove Museveni, then everything will correct automatically and Uganda will become a better place for all”. Some of our young people now believe that if the political party of their choice were to be elected into power, goodies will just flow their way. My sympathies.In addition to reflecting the psyche of our political opposition, the lack of originality on part of the ‘Tuliyambala Engule’ song has some biblical parallels. For some of the biblically unread who have blamed a group of pastors who have opposed weaponising a hymn for political purposes, I refer them to the book of Daniel Chapter five.In this scripture we are told how King Belshazzar gave a great banquet to his nobles whereupon he ordered to bring the gold and silver goblets that Nebuchadnezzar his farther had taken from the temple in Jerusalem.He used these sacred goblets to serve his nobles, concubines and wives while they praised the false gods. God got annoyed and the biblical writings on the wall appeared condemning the King and the subsequent punishment. This should be the basis for our pastors to oppose the usage of a known hymn for unholy partisan political purposes.Even common sense would suggest that publically held spiritual assets can/should not be used by individuals promoting their partisan agenda.Can you imagine what would happen if an NRM supporter used our National Anthem as foundation music for a song to enumerate the successes of the NRM government – I would oppose it much as I am a staunch supporter of the NRM?Writer is the chairman, Governance Plus Advisory Services				googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });							googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });									googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1501674874561-0'); });					"

File Photo					But as you read this, the beef that started from a critique to one part has taken yet another twist			googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1496656157133-0'); });		It has been going on for the last few months. But the ostensible rift between two pop divas, Sheebah and Cindy, was only in verbal altercations.  Then, at a certain point the rift, popularized by both the mainstream and social media, descended to the fans. It was the fans arguing about “Who Is Who?” of the two artistes. But as you read this, the beef that started from a critique to one part has taken yet another twist. This time, a big, fundamental face that eliminates any signs and hopes of it ending soon. The beef is in the studio. Gloves off and bare knuckles, you can conclude. To climax the backlashes largely orchestrated by the media, Cindy released ‘Copy Cat’, an obvious nudge on Sheebah, who she criticizes for being “lacking in creativity.” As a reply to the attacks, Sheebah hit the studio to record 'Kimansulo' and 'Jealousy' which are believed to be counter diss tracks to Cindy. It is not clear who first released a song, but obviously, the songs are gaining momentum on the playlists of their fans. Radio, TV, and Online media are discussing the songs. In her Patois-themed single, Cindy insinuates that her nemesis is not original, who imitates them who are original, thus the tag “copycat.” Cindy takes the battle a notch higher. Her lyrics in the song loosely translate as, “If you think you compete with me and showing that you diss, why do you fright?”  Cindy is in the studio working on new material. File PhotoFor those who have followed the battle know that a music performance battle had been suggested, similar to what Bobi Wine and Bebe Cool had back in 2011. Cindy was upbeat and seemingly ready. Sheebah rejected it. So the line in Cindy’s song can be interpreted as a sarcastic jab to Sheebah’s perceived frights. In both media and the song, Sheebah has portrayed Cindy as a jealous, who is envious of her achievements. In Jealousy, Sheeba sings, “Shame upon you, know I am going nowhere. I will be in your ear, so you remember your biggest fear... When I have a nice hairstyle, it hurts. When I have a song, it hurts you…” Sheebah plays the victim card. Cindy, on the hand, minces no words. Earlier, when the musical performance battle was suggested, Cindy sarcastically noted, “We are not at the same level. Sheebah is a great artiste, she is very entertaining. She just needs a little more practice and then we can have a battle which is fair because it wouldn’t be fair to put me on a stage with Sheebah right now.” In another jab, Cindy called Sheebah a ""CD artiste"" who cannot perform with a live band and therefore a battle right now would just destroy her. “You cannot do a battle on CD. It has to be live,” Cindy provoked. Sheebah in a counterattack reminded Cindy that she has not built a house despite spending so many years in the music industry. As it rages, we can only hope it doesn’t go sour. Let us watch the space.				googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1496657157715-0'); });							googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });							googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });									googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1501674874561-0'); });					"

The Ugandan Community in North America numbers over 120,000 individuals. The organization aims to promote the social, cultural and economic development of the Ugandan Community in North America and beyond. To promote his candidature, Muwulya was joined by Kyadondo East MP Robert Kyagulanyi also known as Bobi Wine and his colleague Mityana Municipality MP Francis Zaake, who rallied Ugandans in the diaspora to vote for Muwulya as their next president for UNAA.  “My brother you are eloquent and far-sighted.

This thin line can be seen under the Public Order Management Act 2013 (POMA) if you have ever witnessed the Uganda Police do battle with activists and protesters who are accused of holding illegal meetings, demonstrations or processions. Since the last general elections of 2016, several disruptive political demonstrations and riots have graced our political scene. I have seen some orderly political meetings, assemblies or demonstrations during that period, but these have not been able to redeem the negative image of the POMA. As a result, many people are left wondering whether the POMA and its enforcement is serving us more chaos than the public order it promised.			googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611395617-0'); });					googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611395617-0'); });		From the perspective of legislative intent, it is not a comfortable claim to say that the POMA achieves its purpose of safeguarding public order if destruction, chaos, teargas and bloody faces perennially show up whenever it is invoked by the Police and military to quell protests. On their part, prominent political actors like Hon. Kyagulanyi a.k.a Bobi Wine and Rt. Colonel Kizza Besigye take the championship of receiving the most wrath when the Uganda Police and security apply the POMA to their events. The government maintains that the duo are up to no good as they are simply defiant but the duo also assert that they are exercising their constitutional freedom to assemble and demonstrate.To juxtapose the need for a government to maintain public order and balance it against the universal right of citizens to protest and demonstrate is something that has eluded many governments around the world. Even mature democracies like France where the government is still confronting the yellow vest protests, it has not escaped criticism for high handedness or use of excessive force in some instances. The only difference between France and Uganda is that the former has employed various political and consultative approaches to engage the protesters instead of using the brute force of the Police frequently. Generally speaking, the use of brute force has the potential of generating violence which begets even more violence. I would like to assume that this is the reason we have ended up in a gridlock of regular and cyclic violent protests in Uganda. It is debatable whether might is always right but it is not debatable that all Ugandans irrespective of their ethnic, religious, political or socio-economic standing deserve to live and work in a peaceful and orderly country.I, therefore, believe that it is time for us to take stock and audit the effectiveness of the POMA as a law which is supposed to serve the public interest to maintain public order before that law delivers another bad story. Uganda desperately needs some good stories which when they appear, often do a considerable repair job of our national image. It does not make sense for us to have a good story about Uganda Airlines in the same month we have local and international media buzzing with ghastly images of the Police battering protesters. This gives the country a sweet and sour image, basically a distorted image which undermines our efforts to promote Uganda as a peaceful country which is ready for business.I have singled out the POMA for fault because under S.8 thereof, it gives Police discretionary powers to stop or prevent the holding of a public meeting which is surprisingly defined to also include processions and demonstration. This is the provision of the law that most opponents find very repugnant. The repugnance bellies in the fact that the provision is prohibitive and not just regulatory of a constitutional right to assemble and demonstrate under Article 29(i) (d) of the Constitution. Established principles of constitutional interpretation maintain that the constitution reigns supreme over subsidiary legislation like the POMA.			googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611604321-0'); });					googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611604321-0'); });		Under the said S.8 of the POMA, the Police can stop a public meeting if they think that the venue where the public meeting is to be held is unsuitable for purposes of the traffic or crowd control or that the meeting will interfere with other lawful businesses. The law does not provide the specs for a suitable venue, traffic or crowd against which the exercise of the Police authority can be measured. This has become a breeding ground for fierce contests about the interpretation of that provision. The sceptics argue that the powers granted to the Police under the above section are vague, open-ended and liable to abuse and political machinations.				googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1501674790852-0'); });			Because of the obvious difficulties of enforcing the POMA by the Police, we appear to have sowed the seeds of defiance and unwillingness to obey the directives of the Police especially with regard to political meetings and demonstrations. The Courts have offered some guidance on the matter but their decisions like that in Muwanga Kivumbi Vs AG constitutional Petition No.9 of 2008 which nullified Police powers under S.32 Police Act cap 303 have come to nothing because the aforesaid nullified provision was re-enacted under S. 8 of the POMA.The Constitutional Court is yet to pronounce itself in Constitutional Petition No. 56/2013 Human Rights Network and 2 others Vs Attorney General which is challenging the constitutionality of S.8 of the POMA. So for the moment, the confusion around the application and enforcement of the POMA continues. This is the kind of background which has ensured that the enforcement of the POMA is gaining the reputation of serving us with more chaos than the Public order it was designed to deliver.It is, therefore, my considered opinion that the ubiquity of the chaos we are experiencing in Uganda during political demonstrations is an indicator that the POMA labours under a design defec"
