An aerial view of Queen Elizabeth National Park  Police spokesperson Fred Enanga in a statement said Byaruhanga was “highly involved” in the post kidnap demands as well as planning and carrying out kidnappings. Police also link the suspect to aggravated robberies and the murder of a resident in Kanungu Town Council.  “We plan to file additional charges against him and his criminal associates. The task team is also reviewing circumstances under which members of this local kidnapping ring were granted bail on similar kidnap before the court,” he said.    Despite the April 2 incident, Police said they are making progress in clamping down on kidnaps in the country.   “We want to inform the public that the Police and its sister security agencies have largely been successful in efforts to combat kidnappings in the country…A large part of the success is attributed to the effective anti-kidnap strategies in place with close cooperation from the community,” he said.“So far the kidnapping ring in Kanungu district has been dismantled, additional suspects are being processed and the operation to apprehend the known remaining perpetrators of the criminal kidnapping enterprise is still ongoing.” Press release pic.twitter.com/Jlt8RUdHyH\n",

She was kidnapped on February 7 and killed 21 days later after her killers sought a ransom of $1m (sh3.6b) from her family.Magara was a cashier for the Hoima-based Bwendero Dairy Farm, but she was based at the farm’s procurement offices located along Kabaka Anjagala Road in Mengo, Kampala.Police said there was a new wave of crime where bank employees collude with criminal gangs to kidnap and rob clients who have withdrawn huge sums of cash.Simon Mulongo, a security expert said criminals have advanced from pick-pocketing to direct attacks, warning that the Police have to revise their methods of cracking down hard-core criminals.“It is a wave that comes in at a certain time and it is related to income,” Mulongo said during a telephone interview with New Vision, recently.A report by the Police’s Flying Squad Unit revealed that they broke the racket that orchestrates the act but warned families to vet their housemaids before employing them.“Criminals are loving the daring kidnap act because it is lucrative. Even some family member’s stage kidnaps to reap from their parents,” excerpts of the report read.According to the report, “School going children from wealthy families are faking kidnaps to negotiate ransom fees from their parents/guardians. We probed two cases in Kampala and Kayunga respectively.”  In other cases, parents that have disputes or separated in their marriages pick children from school without the others notice to forcefully have custody of the child, prompting reporting kidnap cases, according to the report.  Top Kidnap cases were reported at police stations in different areas that include; Kampala (Bugolobi, Kawempe, Old Kampala, Kira, Kireka, Kasangati, Kasubi and Katwe), Kyenjonjo, Mukono, Mpigi and Nakaseke districts.The recently released annual crime report indicated that a total of 216 persons were registered as victims of Kidnap/Abductions in 2017. Of these, 191 were recovered and united with relatives, 22 are still missing and 03 were killed.Police is yet to release the 2018 crime report.\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1501674874561-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\n",

Therefore, he did not hesitate to follow him,” said Nassali, the deceased's mother.Onyango said Mukisa led their detectives to a farm located in Bbira-Nakabugo, on Wednesday where they retrieved the remains of the deceased.\"The little boy was kidnapped on the January 24, 2019 and later Police recovered his body that was wrapped in a mosquito net on January 30, 2019. However, parts of his body including the genitals and the tongue were missing,\" said Henry Nsubuga, the neighbour to Nassali.After recovering the boy's body, the self-confessed killer, Mukisa told police detectives thata there is another person (woman) whom he murdered and after dumped her body in a swamp at Busega, along Kampala-Masaka road.On Thursday, he (Mukisa) led Police to the said swamp but after a long search, he changed and said he had dumped the body in Masaka.The suspect also claimed to have hacked to death his former girlfriend and later dumped her body in a swamp at Busega.“He led our detectives to the second scene but after a long search, he changed his statement and said he dumped the body in Masaka not in Busega,” he said.“He further claimed someone tasked him to get  him at least two people for sacrifice and that is the reason why  we have decided to intensify our investigations until we get to the bottom  of the matter,\" said Onyango.He added that they have preferred charges of kidnap and murder against the suspect and upon completion of their investigations; they will arraign him in Court.Sharon Kayitesi, a resident of Gogonya said this is the third person to die in very horrible style.“In November, a 60-year-old woman identified as Ruth Nansubuga was hacked to death inside her house while Amos Kiyingi, a builder was also kidnapped from his home in the same area at around 8:00pm and was murdered at 1:00am on November 26, 2018,” she said.\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1496657157715-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1501674874561-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\n",

Photo/File\t\t\t\t\tFollowing the latest American kidnap incident, President Yoweri Museveni assured both Ugandans and foreign tourists that his country is safe and vowed: “to deal with these isolated pockets of criminals.”\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1496656157133-0'); });\t\tKAMPALA - The release of a kidnapped American tourist, Kimberley Sue Endicott, and her tour guide, Jean-Paul Mirenge, on April 7, did not only send a rippling sense of relief to her family and friends but also to officials in Kampala.The duo, kidnapped on Tuesday, April 2, from the remote Ishaka sector of Queen Elizabeth National Park in western Uganda, was released after a $30,000(about sh112m) ransom was reportedly paid to the kidnappers.The release left officials in Uganda heaving a sigh of relief and thumping their chests for what they called a successful rescue mission despite criticism that paying a ransom could easily fire-up more criminal acts.Since the incident, eight suspects have been arrested in connection with the crime and one suspected kidnapper, Onesmus Byaruhanga charged this week. Supposedly, they were identified after a tracking device was planted in the ransom bag.Weeks before the kidnap happened, the Ugandan government had embarked on a vigorous campaign to promote the country’s tourism sector that is Uganda’s leading foreign exchange earner with 1.32 million tourists annually. In 2016/17, tourism brought in $1.4 billion, 4.3% GDP and 26% of exports.One of the tourism campaigns dubbed Tulambule (let’s tour) aimed at awakening local tourism by encouraging Ugandans to visit tourism sites that many perceived for outside-the-country visitors.Another campaign, “Miss Curvy Uganda,” backfired. It marketed female Ugandans with well-curved bodies as a tourist attraction. The Church protested it. Church leaders, including the archbishop of the Church of Uganda, Stanley Ntagali, observed that it exploited females and violated women’s values.It was amidst this controversial campaign period that kidnappers struck and abducted the American tourist, infuriating the leadership in Kampala that boasts of securing all the borders of the country. Note that tourism in Uganda is as important to this small East African country of 47.5 million people as oil is to Saudi Arabia. The country’s main tourism sector has features such as game parks, freshwater bodies like Lake Victoria (the biggest in Africa), River Nile (the longest in the world) and mountains such as Elgon and Rwenzori.What is more, a recent survey conducted by InterNations an, international community and information site for people who live and work abroad, indicated that Uganda ranks fifth among the top 10 countries globally where expatriates easily make new friends and generally feel at home.Gifted by natural beauty, Uganda was in 1908 christened “Pearl of Africa” by Winston Churchill, a former British prime minister.  In 2017, it was named the fourth-best tourism destination in the world by Rough Guides, a leading travel publisher.The kidnapers touched Uganda’s heart, which explains why the government responded the way it did not only to rescue Endicott but also its cash cow, the tourism sector. As soon as the news about the kidnap started circulating, Police deployed some of its best commandos to the game park that borders the lawless eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).Between March and May 2018, 81 cases of the kidnap of Ugandans were reported to Police in the country, according to a report produced by the defunct Flying Squad and the Criminal Investigations Directorate (CID). At that and with the recent focus on an abducted American woman, few were looking at the fact that roughly 100,000 people are kidnapped worldwide each year.Is Uganda safe?Whereas kidnaps of ordinary Ugandans for ransom have become a growing concern in Kampala, for decades tourists visiting Uganda have been safe from the kidnappers. Tourists routinely roam the streets in Kampala and upcountry freely without any incident.Following the latest American kidnap incident, President Yoweri Museveni assured both Ugandans and foreign tourists that his country is safe and vowed: “to deal with these isolated pockets of criminals.”Uganda Tourism Board (UTB) chief executive officer, Lilly Ajarova, also issued a statement saying the abduction at the Queen Elizabeth National Park was a “one-off” incident that doesn’t adversely reflect the security situation in parks and the country. And despite the latest kidnap incident, safety and security-Uganda travel guidelines assert that this country is safe to visit as the risk zones particularly in the north are clearly defined and can easily be avoided.The Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) also insisted that tourists moving out on a drive in the park should always go with the armed ranger guides even as game parks are heavily protected by Uganda People Defense Force (UPDF) soldiers well aware that the facilities could attract wrong elements. At the time Endicott was kidnapped on a drive, she did not have armed escorts.The travel guidelines indicate that “Uganda’s tourism highlights are located in safe areas, and the risk zones are easily avoided without compromising your safari.”Queen Elizabeth national park, one of Uganda’s most famous wildlife reserves, borders the Virunga National Park of DRC, the oldest in Africa. Harm to tourists has occurred in the Congo.While Ugandan officials are certainly more diligent now and watching borders since the April incident, there are nine other national parks worthy of visits and away from the DRC border.  Tourists are urged to come to any of those.\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1496657157715-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1501674874561-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\n"

However Saturday Vision has learnt that apparently the perpetrators of the kidnap had a profile of a key engineer who manned the switchboard on August 1, 2005, who they wanted when the helicopter Garang was traveling in crashed into a southern Sudan mountain range in bad weather, killing 13 people on board.It was believed that the pilot made distress calls just minutes before the crash. There could have been fears that these messages might have been received by various persons, which could have resulted in the events that led to the kidnap of the MTN Engineer,” the source revealed.Efforts to get a comment from Ndawula were futile by press time, save for a few close family friends who mentioned that there was really no further course of action any more in the matter, which has been put to rest and they really thank God that the victim is alive and well, which is the most important thing. Ndawula was kidnapped five days after that fateful crash and his whereabouts remained unknown. He however, recently resurfaced and wedded on December 14, 2018.For several years, different media houses reported him as a missing person while others quoted family members stating he might have been killed. In an interview with the media a few years after his disappearance, family members said they had received rumors that he might have been killed and his body buried far from sight. However, the family did not believe him to be dead because his body had never been found and different family members had had dreams of Ndawula returning home.At the time of Ndawula's disappearance, his father Kigongo Musiige was working at the National Curriculum Development Centre. Shortly after, he retired, and spent much of his time searching for his son and traveled to far off districts and different places searching for him, but all visits yielded no results.The family also kept all newspaper clippings on Ndawula's disappearance, which were placed in a neat pile next to his bed. His bed was fully made and the sheets are washed often, in the hope that when he returned, he would have a clean warm bed to sleep on.His company not only helped to search for Ndawula, but also placed numerous radio and newspaper adverts calling for information into the case.\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1496657157715-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1501674874561-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\t Game driver Jean Paul Mirenge (left) and Sue Endecott were abducted in Queen Elizabeth National Park ealier this month. (Courtesy photo)\t\t\t\t\tTourism is the single highest foreign currency earner in Uganda. \t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1496656157133-0'); });\t\tOPINION By Kyetume Kasanga                                    Four gunmen kidnapped American tourist Kimberly Sue and her Ugandan driver, Jean Paul Mirenge in Queen Elizabeth National Park on April 9, 2019. For the duo’s release, the terrorists received $30,000 (sh112m) after protracted negotiations. The money was a refund of costs the kidnappers purportedly incurred during five hostage days in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.Helped by the US military, Ugandan security later arrested eight suspects. The gig drama was mouth-watering because it will surge the country’s tourist arrivals as it captivated international media coverage. As well as highlight Uganda’s tourism to the outside world, none of the international press slipped into the habitual despondency about the country or her government. Even Canada, who validated travel advisory to her citizens four days after the rescue mission, warned them only to “Exercise a high degree of caution in Uganda due to muggings and theft, especially in urban centres.”Tourism is the single highest foreign currency earner in Uganda. Uganda Bureau of Statistics reports show the country received 1.8 million tourists last year, up from 1.4 million in 2017. This year’s target is 2.8 million. The 1.4 million arrivals ploughed in $1.4b (sh5,243b), up from $1.35b (sh5,056b) in 2016, contributing about 24% of total exports and 10% of GDP.The international press mentioned that 67-year-old Queen Elizabeth which is one of 10 National Parks is the most popular safari destinations in the country, home to over half of the world’s endangered mountain gorillas. It offers opportunity to see dozens of enormous craters carved dramatically into rolling green hills, as well as coalitions and prides of about 50 rare tree-climbing lions sleeping the day away hidden in the fig and acacia trees, ready to pounce on herds of unsuspecting Uganda kobs.Habituated chimpanzees steal the show in Kyambura Gorge, obstinacy of 10,000 African Cape buffaloes and parades of 3,000 elephants walk leisurely in the sprawling savanna grasslands that are set against the backdrop of jagged Rwenzori Mountains. International media also captured a crash of 5,000 hippopotami that line the banks of panoramic Kazinga Channel and 619 bird species in easy watch.The media also picked good comments by Indigo Ellis, the lead DR Congo analyst for Verisk Maplecroft, a UK-based research firm specialising in global risk analysis, who said that cases of tourist kidnap are extremely rare in Uganda. The statement has a ripple effect to encourage Uganda-destined tourists.Like Canada, the US ranks Uganda as a Level 2 Travel Advisory Nation, the same level with France and Belgium. The level asks US citizens to be alert about petty crimes, but should not be alarmed (while in Uganda). At Level 3, they are warned to “Reconsider Travel”, while at Level 4, which is the highest level of alertness, they are stopped from travelling.Favourable coverage was by the influential American Cable News Network (CNN) which is available in over 100 million US households. CNN broadcast coverage extends to over 890,000 American hotel rooms, as well as carriage on subscription providers throughout neighbouring Canada. It is also available to about 96.4 million US pay-television households (82.8% of households with at least one television set). Globally, CNN programming airs through CNN International, which is viewed in 212 countries.Paris-based Agence France-Presse (AFP), the world's oldest news agency at 187 years and now the third largest news agency, also fairly covered the incident. Through six languages it transmits in 151 countries via multimedia. The British Reuters with coverage in 16 languages around the world was also in the fray. Each day, over one billion people worldwide consume its news through multiple platforms. It is subscribed to by over 750 television broadcasters in 115 countries, 1,000 newspapers including 13 of the top 15 globally, 33 million monthly unique visitors to their website Reuters.com and two million active viewers of Reuters TV.The incident also attracted good coverage from Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), a New York-based television and radio service. CBS owns or is affiliated to more than 240 television stations throughout the US. Some of them are also accessed in Canada via pay-television providers or in border areas over-the-air.Expectedly, Voice of America had a direct interest in the kidnap and rescue. It is a dynamic broadcaster in over 40 languages. Serving an estimated global audience of more than 275 million, VoA is a US government-funded international multimedia agency working as the Federal government's official external broadcaster. It is the largest US international broadcaster, with several affiliated media houses. These include Mynet, a leading internet portal in Turkey with over 6.5 million registered members and 38 million monthly unique visitors.President Donald Trump who keenly followed the events in Uganda tweeted shortly after the rescue announcement was made: “Pleased to report that the American tourist and tour guide that were abducted in Uganda have been released. God bless them and their families!” The tweet garnered about 23,000 re-tweets, 118,000 ‘likes’ and 5,600 replies. Trump has over 59.6 million twitter followers, according to Socialbakers.com, a digital marketing platform for social media.Statistics from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime pitch Mexico as the most dangerous countries with reported kidnaps. There were nearly 1,200 in 2017 but almost 11 million Americans vacationed there. Brazil had around 1,000 kidnaps in 2012 but about 5.7 million visitors went there. Likewise, in the Philippines 27 foreigners were kidnapped in 2018 but there were 7.1 million visitor arrivals. In its recorded history, Uganda has not had as much abduction.The international exposure through aggregate media coverage of the Kimberly incident is rare but great mileage for Uganda’s tourism sector growth. The sector should pick traction to be robust, marshal employment and rake in more revenues.The writer is the Principal Information Officer at the Ministry of ICT &amp; National Guidance \t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1496657157715-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1501674874561-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\n",

The kidnappers, he adds, have since asked for a sh2m ransom.“One person was this morning (07/01/19) allegedly kidnapped for a ransom in DRC. The victim, one Isaya Mbeeta, of Munyaga cell western wad, Butogota township, was allegedly kidnapped at around 10:00 hours from the garden in DRC,” Onyango says.Onyango says Mbeeta was alone when two militias armed with one rifle emerged from the bush, overpowered him and dragged him into the nearby bush.“He is said to have left his home very early in the morning at around 05:00 hours. Efforts by our forces to get him rescued are being made,” Onyango says.The Eastern DRC has over time experienced heavy fighting between militia groups and the DRC army, a move that has forced thousands to flee the violence into Uganda as refugees.\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1496657157715-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1518611800417-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1501674874561-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\n"
