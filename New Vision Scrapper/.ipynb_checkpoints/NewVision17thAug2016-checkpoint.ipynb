The report reveals that food borne illness is recognized to be a public health problem among Ugandans.  Agaba said the purpose of the report is to foster global health security, promote economic growth and development and strengthen evidence based policy making.  Speaking during the launch of the report the state minister in charge of primary health care Sarah Opendi noted that , millions of people around the World become ill from food and water borne diseases, of these an estimated 3m people die annually with 700,000 estimated deaths occurring in Africa due to diarrhea associated with contaminated food.  \"Although cases of food borne diseases occur daily in all countries, there is a severe under reporting of such diseases, particularly in developing countries including Uganda. Consequently the true prevalence of food borne diseases in Uganda and the rest of the World is unknown,\" Opendi said. She said that the occurrence of such diseases can easily raise food safety emergency situations which can adversely impact local and national economies and livelihoods through reduced availability of food for domestic consumption and also export markets. Opendi expressed concern that public has ignored the importance of nutrition and yet it is key for their health. She called for a National food safety.  The executive director Uganda National Bureau of Standards, Ben Manyindo, said a large proportion of food borne disease incidents are caused by food improperly prepared in establishments like restaurant and markets, and at home.   \"Food safety is a public health concern and should be given priority,\" Manyindo added.  World Health Organization (WHO) in the past set up five keys to food safety. These have been shown to be handy tips for anyone in the trade or domestic settings to ensure safe eating. They include; choosing food products you are buying, making sure that the packing is intact, storage condition is proper, and watch out for the expiry date.  The second step is to clean your kitchens, chopping boards, utensils and refrigerators and to wash hands before eating. Use different utensils when required to handle raw and cooked food, in order to avoid cross contamination of foods. Others are ensuring that food is well cooked to kill germs and avoid leaving any food at room temperature, especially the dangerous zone 4C to 60C, for more than two hours. Ensure your refrigerator and freezer function normally. \t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1455287563552-0');\t\t\t\t\t\t});\t\t\t\t\t-->\t\t\t\t\t\tif (!window.OX_ads) { OX_ads = []; }\t\t\tOX_ads.push({ \"auid\" : \"538501068\" });\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdocument.write('');\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-->\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1476881418688-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1476881242577-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1455287729031-0');\t\t\t\t\t\t});\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1455287629526-0');\t\t\t\t\t\t});\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t14 percent of ailments are food borne related\t\t\t\t\n",

Drought-induced crop failure and food shortage in Karamoja should no longer surprise anyone.With or without a food security forecast, it is expected anyway. This is what happens when you do the same thing over and over again and expect different results. Food aid is not a solution to Karamoja’s food security challenge, not anymore!Now, is the time for our leaders and policy makers to stop treating the manifestation of the actual problem in Karamoja and treat the key underlying cause of Karamoja’s food security challenge – lack of water for crop production, especially in the dry season.Failure to realize and/or accept that water is all that Karamoja needs to address its food security challenge has made Government to prescribe the wrong remedy – food aid for so many years. As expected, wrong remedies to a particular problem will result into resistance.Karamoja has clearly developed resistance to food aid, at least, in terms of resolving its food security challenge in the long term.Giving food aid to the more than 50,000 people who are currently experiencing serious food shortage in Karamoja this year is likely to improve their food security, in the very short term but overall may undermine the local agricultural production and threaten food security in the long-term.Each time I read about Karamoja’s food shortages, one question keeps lingering in my mind: Why should a region so rich and so blessed with vast resources keep suffering?An analysis of budget allocations and revenue from the environment and natural resource sector in Karamoja region conducted by the Advocates Coalition for Development and Environment (ACODE) in 2011 described Karamoja as one of the richest and most highly-endowed of all the five regions of Uganda in terms of natural resources with up to 40% of the wildlife protected areas including 19 forest reserves; minerals such as gold, iron ore, magnetite and marble; and prospects for oil and gas.Despite the vast natural resources in Karamoja region, it remains the poorest and the most underdeveloped region in Uganda. While local revenue from the natural resources would ideally be able to improve the situation, to some extent, the study conducted by ACODE revealed that the local governments in each of the seven districts in Karamoja region were hardly able to raise 1% of their annual budgets from local revenue in any of the previous five financial years.Local governments in the Karamoja region should lobby, within their councils, for an increment in local revenue from their natural resources. The local revenue could contribute to increasing the availability of water for crop production through water harvesting technologies.As part of its risk reduction strategies, the Department of Relief, Disaster Preparedness and Management should urgently begin to provide non-emergency food aid in form of irrigation facilities and water harvesting technologies in various parts of Karamoja region.Mass sensitization on how best to utilize and benefit from the water harvesting technologies and irrigation facilities would be an icing on the cake. If all the interventions that have a component of improving Karamoja’s food security focus on increasing availability of water for crop production, the usual disgraceful drought-induced food shortages will be no more in Karamoja in the near future.The writer is a researcher with the Advocates Coalition for Development and Environment \t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1455287563552-0');\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1476881418688-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1476881242577-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1455287729031-0');\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1455287629526-0');\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRelevancy of NGOs to Uganda and why they need Government Support\t\t\t\t\n",

The donation was announced Friday by the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) in Kampala.According to a statement by the WFP, the United States made a contribution of US$15.4m with Australia contributing US$ 2.3m.In the statement, the WFP country representative Alice Martin –Daihirou noted that the funding from both nations will support refugees and extremely food insecure households in Karamoja.“These generous contributions have come at a critical time and will allow WFP to support nearly 460,000 people both Ugandans and refugees with lifesaving assistance for three to four months,” said Alice Martin-Daihirou.He noted that WFP still requires additional funding in order to continue providing full rations to all refugees through the end of the year.According to the World food Program, US$7.6M is needed monthly to provide basic food and nutrition support to refugees.Currently, the WFP assists 303,000 refugees in Uganda playing a key role as part of a coordinated effort under the UN High commission for Refugees (UNHCR).  The influx of people fleeing the conflict in South Sudan over the last 14 months tripled WFP’s funding requirements to meet refugees’ basic food and nutrition needs. The numbers of refugees are projected to grow to 383,000 by December.In January, the lack of funding forced WFP to cut food rations for 146,000 refugees who had arrived in Uganda before July 2013.However WFP explained that the ration cuts have not affected the new South Sudanese refugees arriving in Uganda since fighting broke out in their country in mid –December 2013.With the US and Australia contributions, WFP Plans to provide a market opportunity for small scale farmer groups by supporting local food purchases.\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1455287563552-0');\t\t\t\t\t\t});\t\t\t\t\t-->\t\t\t\t\t\tif (!window.OX_ads) { OX_ads = []; }\t\t\tOX_ads.push({ \"auid\" : \"538501068\" });\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdocument.write('');\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-->\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1476881418688-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1476881242577-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1455287729031-0');\t\t\t\t\t\t});\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1455287629526-0');\t\t\t\t\t\t});\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBreastfeeding mothers should be screened for HIV\t\t\t\t\n",

The decree says that banned food products that are smuggled into the country must be destroyed from August 6 this year.The embargo has seen truckloads of delicacies, from cheese to pate, stopped at the border, with allegations swirling that products are being re-labelled in neighbouring ex-Soviet countries and imported illegally.   Up until now, any smuggled produce being caught has been turned around and sent back.The decree did not make it clear whether the food would be destroyed immediately at the border. It calls for the government to decide on a procedure for destruction.At a meeting with Putin last week, agriculture minister Alexander Tkachev called for produce to be destroyed by customs officers.The decree still allows people to bring in banned foods for personal consumption.Yevgeny Bobrov, a member of the Kremlin rights council, an advisory body, last week called the proposal to destroy food \"high-handedness,\" saying smuggled food should be given to the less well-off.AFP \t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1455287563552-0');\t\t\t\t\t\t});\t\t\t\t\t-->\t\t\t\t\t\tif (!window.OX_ads) { OX_ads = []; }\t\t\tOX_ads.push({ \"auid\" : \"538501068\" });\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdocument.write('');\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-->\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1476881418688-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1476881242577-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1455287729031-0');\t\t\t\t\t\t});\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1455287629526-0');\t\t\t\t\t\t});\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPutin orders destruction of smuggled Western food\t\t\t\t\n",

In the same year, we designed a research protocol to assess the food security and nutritional status of children residing in Nabitambala parish, Busede sub-county, Jinja district. This sub-county has history of longstanding involvement in sugarcane growing. We investigated a total of 382 households. Within these households, lived a total of 646 children whose nutritional status we assessed. We found that a half of the households we assessed had severe food insecurity and only 12% were food secure. Approximately 2 out of every ten children had acute malnutrition, a third (215 children) had stunted growth and more than a quarter (167 children) was underweight. An estimated 8%, 10% and 15% of the children were found to be severely wasted, underweight and stunted respectively. Going by the World Health Organization grading of the problem of malnutrition, the level of stunted growth and underweight seen in our research was considered high while the level of wasting had reached a critical level.Indeed during our day to day research activities, it was common for us to find severely malnourished children with impoverished parents who could not even afford to transport their sick children to the nutrition unit in Nalufenya. Our vehicle on many occasions acted as ambulance to transport such cases. At Nalufenya, we got to learn that majority of the malnourished came from predominantly sugarcane growing communities. It was surprising to note that although households appeared food insecure with visible signs of hunger especially among women and children, many of the women we saw had on average five to seven biological children who were closely spaced. The men looked to be redundant probably because once mature, sugarcane does not need to be weeded yet it is the only business available in these communities. It is probably this business of not being occupied that creates time for getting the babies. We realised that malnutrition was more common in households with many children compared to those with few.But is sugarcane growing the cause of this unfortunate yet avoidable state of affair? Going by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) definition of food security, one may say no. The FAO says that food security exists when ‘all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food…’ From this definition we can be able to say that an individual can access food by growing it or through buying using cash. We can therefore say that engagement in cash crop production may not fully explain the food insecurity which has culminated into the poor nutrition status of children in this region. Such communities are expected to generate enough income from sale of the cash crop which could be used to increase their purchasing power for foodstuffs. It is surprising that the money generated from the cash crop is not transformed into food. We however, do not know whether these people are paid peanuts for their produce to the extent that they cannot afford to buy food. But if it is true that they are paid peanuts, why is it that they continue to grow the sugarcane year in year out? Is there a tendency for men to take all the money paid to them and at the end do not support their children and wives? If so why are these men different from the men in urban areas who also do not have gardens but support their wives and children in rented rooms? It should be understood that our research was conducted among sugarcane out growers. In many of the households, sugarcane was grown up to the door steps living a very limited space (if any) for food crop production. What puzzles me however, is that as we blame sugarcane production for causation of malnutrition in this region, Bushenyi, the so called Uganda’s food basket has also been covered in a blanked of malnutrition. In face of this dilemma, what could be the way forward for this problem which is threatening lives of the innocent children in these communities?We should understand that solving the problem of malnutrition in food crop growing communities is much easier and cheaper than doing so among cash crop producers. It is therefore important that measures are put in place to ensure that families spare some land for food production. It also appears that men have more powers over land ownership than females yet it is the females who struggle to look for food. In this aspect, women need to be empowered to enable them make decision in regards to allocating land for food crop production.As a short term remedy, we should map the sugarcane growing communities and label them as communities which are at risk of malnutrition. By doing so community based management of malnutrition can be intensified in these communities thereby bringing services nearer to individuals who are not able to move to health facilities. There is also need to increase family planning uptake among couples of these communities as a way of mitigating the problem of malnutrition.The writer is a public health specialist with interest in public health nutrition programming\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1455287563552-0');\t\t\t\t\t\t});\t\t\t\t\t-->\t\t\t\t\t\tif (!window.OX_ads) { OX_ads = []; }\t\t\tOX_ads.push({ \"auid\" : \"538501068\" });\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdocument.write('');\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-->\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1476881418688-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1476881242577-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1455287729031-0');\t\t\t\t\t\t});\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1455287629526-0');\t\t\t\t\t\t});\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFace to face with malnutrition in sugarcane growing communities of Busoga\t\t\t\t\n",

      "By Samuel Sanya and Rachael Nabisubi The purchasing power of the shilling is up. Recent data from the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) indicates that year-on-year inflation dropped to 1.3% at the end of January. Annual inflation declined from 1.8% recorded in December 2015. Chris Mukiza, the UBOS director for macro-economic statistics, says the decline in inflation is due to decrease in food prices due to the harvest season and declining fuel prices. “There was a continued deflation in annual food prices to 3.3% in January 2015, compared to 1.9% recorded during the year ended December 2014,” Mukiza said. “The annual non-food inflation declined to 3.5% at the end of January 2015, compared to 3.6% at the end of December 2014,” he added. Core inflation, which excludes food, fuel, electricity and metered water, stood at 2.7%, unchanged from December. There were decreases in the prices of bananas, sweet potatoes, cassava, and other foods, the statistics office said, which drove down the January food inflation by 2%. UBOS data also indicates that prices for fuel, clothing, transport fares and other non-food items also decreased. Mukiza urged Ugandans to consume more local products to ease pressure on the shilling due to a high import bill. Uganda imports $3b more than it exports, which affects its balance of payments position, resulting in a weaker shilling.RELATED STORIES:\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { \t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1446561012149-0')\t\t\t\t\t\t\t;});\t\t\t\t\t\tFood price volatility rises November inflation to 2.1%\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1455287563552-0');\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1476881418688-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1476881242577-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1455287729031-0');\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1455287629526-0');\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInflation rises to 1.4%IMF warns Uganda on inflation \t\t\t\t\tJanuary inflation down to 1.3%\t\t\t\t\n",

      "By Billy RwothungeyoThe World Food Programme (WFP) intends to buy 45,000 metric tons of food from Uganda for over 300,000 people, mostly refugees and vulnerable groups and individuals in Karamoja.In an interview with the  New Vision, Lydia Wamala, the Communications Officer of WFP in Uganda says approximately 60,000 metric tons of food are needed this year.“Of the 60,000 metric tons, WFP would like to buy as much of this food locally in Uganda if funding is available,” she says. “WFP is 100 percent voluntarily funded and our delivery of food assistance is based on available funding.”Wamala though was quick to note that not all food can be produced and purchased in Uganda.“Some commodities such as the specialized nutrition products for addressing malnutrition need to be imported. Also, WFP is careful not to over-purchase and disrupt the local market.”One of the biggest commodities that WFP buys in Uganda is maize. In 2014, partly as a result of improved quality of grain in Uganda, as well as favorable prices, WFP bought 16,000 metric tons of grain worth nearly $6m.The better the quality of grain and the more competitive the prices, the more it is able to buy food on the local/regional markets – from traders and small scale farmer groups.WFP is particular to the quality of grain it buys, and offers quality enhancement support to farmers in terms of modern air-tight silos in Acholi, Teso, southwest and Busoga regions.The UN agency is also working with other partners to assist households and targeted farmers.RELATED STORIES:\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { \t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1446561012149-0')\t\t\t\t\t\t\t;});\t\t\t\t\t\tRussia donates 67 trucks to WFP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1455287563552-0');\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1476881418688-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1476881242577-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1455287729031-0');\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1455287629526-0');\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWFP's $32m investment in Uganda a successWFP buys sh94b Ugandan foodstuffs \t\t\t\t\tWFP to buy more food from Uganda this year\t\t\t\t\n",

      "By Chris Kiwawulo                         The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has  donated $16m (sh48b) to World Food Programme (WFP) in support of  refugees in Uganda and food-insecure people in the Karamoja region.  WFP currently provides food assistance to approximately 300,000 refugees  living in settlements throughout Uganda, as well as 155,000 people from  extremely vulnerable households in Karamoja.“The WFP food basket for these two groups consists of cereals, pulses,  vegetable oil, salt and for some groups, super cereal (fortified  corn-soya blend),” a statement from the US embassy in Kampala revealed.This US contribution under the Protracted Relief and Recovery Operation  will enable WFP to provide about eight months of food assistance to more  than 440,000 people including over 130,000 South Sudanese refugees who  have arrived in Uganda since December 2013. “This contribution comes at a crucial time when WFP has more  beneficiaries to feed with already stretched resources,” WFP acting  Country Representative Michael Dunford was quoted as saying. “It will  enable us to ensure refugees and food-insecure people in Karamoja have  food at the most critical times of the year.” With USAID support, WFP has been able to pilot a cash transfer program in the refugee settlement camps. Dunford noted, “USAID’s backing of the cash transfer pilot program has  been crucial in providing a more dignified transfer to the refugees,  benefits the host community by increasing market demand as well as being  a more cost effective intervention. With additional planned USAID  support, we will be doing a number of assessments this year to inform an  appropriate expansion of this pilot to more refugee settlements.” USAID Uganda Mission Director Leslie Reed explained: “This donation  highlights the U.S. government’s commitment to addressing the  humanitarian food and nutrition needs among both refugees and extremely  vulnerable households in Uganda. It is a combination of traditional in-kind food aid and local and  regional procurement that directly benefits local Ugandan famers.Due to recent food aid reforms, USAID's Office of Food for Peace is able  to purchase commodities on the local market, helping both people in  need as well as local businesses.\"Besides food assistance, USAID has funded many other projects in Uganda  including health, education, environment, agriculture, governance and  human rights. USAID's work is implemented through contracts and grants  with firms and organizations who enter into an agreement with USAID to  support the achievement of our foreign assistance goals via our overseas  development programs.One such project recently funded by USAID was the $50m (sh150.4b)  Northern Uganda Health Integration for Enhanced Services (NUHITES)  project which was being implemented through Plan International Uganda.  However, USAID terminated the NUHITES project over mismanagement. On the other hand, WFP has been active in Uganda since 1963 with  operations generally focused on how best to use food for humanitarian  and development support.In 2008, however, WFP Uganda adopted a new strategy in line with the  organization’s revised and more targeted approach to addressing hunger.According to the WFP Uganda website, donor funding towards WFP Uganda  activities this year is projected at $28.4m (sh85.4b); where  multilaterals are expected to contribute $4.7m, US $15.5m, UK $5.7m and  Australia $2.3m.    RelatedRussia donates 67 trucks to WFPWFP to supply food to 50000 S.SudaneseWFP 'yet to reach' 600,000 typhoon survivors in the Philippines\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { \t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1446561012149-0')\t\t\t\t\t\t\t;});\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1455287563552-0');\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1476881418688-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1476881242577-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1455287729031-0');\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1455287629526-0');\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUS contributes sh48b to feed refugees in Uganda\t\t\t\t\n",

You just carry out a survey across all the malls and supermarkets and you will find out that we are actually better when it comes to hygiene matters.” Ochwo could not rule out the possibility that a competitor could be behind the closure of the fast food outlet. “As Uchumi, we try our best to do the best for our customers,” he added.He invited the members of the public to freely visit their kitchen to see for themselves how standards were being maintained at Uchumi. \t\t\t\t\tUchumi fast food outlet back in business\t\t\t\t\n",

All those operating eateries and serving food will be subjected to medical tests before they are allowed to operate. “All these people have to be diagnosed as a prerequisite to make sure they are in good health to serve others,” he added.Serukka said those found operating eateries without license will be prosecuted.  He said the measures are meant to curb the spread of typhoid in city and other outbreaks like cholera in the future.Last week KCCA closed seven shopping arcades over poor sanitation. Serukka said a total of 2000 typhoid patients have been undergoing treatment since it broke out on February 6. “Majority of the patients are male in their mid-thirties and mainly taxi drivers”.Many of the patients are residents of Kasubi, Nsambya, Kawala and Kazo, operating businesses in Nakasero Market, Owino, Old Park, Qualicell and New Taxi Park. Serukka said they are engaging leaders of Taxi Parks and other affected areas in sensitizing the people on typhoid prevention and treatment.He noted that being a food and waterborne disease, the inspectorate team has been directed to re-inspect, educate and close the potential sources of the infection.At all other Division Urban Authorities, health inspectors are working together with Village Health Teams (VHT) to sensitize the locals on the causes and encouraging them avoid drinking un boiled water, especially that packed in polythene bags.\"We are sensitizing people through leaders of different groups like market leaders, boda-boda riders and youth groups,\" the deputy Mayor Nakawa, Betty Tushabe said.Rubaga division town clerk, James Luyimbazi said they already embarked on the inspection of all eating places to make sure the required standards are followed.  \t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1455287563552-0');\t\t\t\t\t\t});\t\t\t\t\t-->\t\t\t\t\t\tif (!window.OX_ads) { OX_ads = []; }\t\t\tOX_ads.push({ \"auid\" : \"538501068\" });\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdocument.write('');\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-->\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1476881418688-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1476881242577-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1455287729031-0');\t\t\t\t\t\t});\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1455287629526-0');\t\t\t\t\t\t});\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTyphoid: KCCA sets tough measures for food vendors\t\t\t\t\n",

Uganda is second.In Africa, the report notes that only four countries—Algeria, Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia—have achieved MDG one as the world starts to craft the post-MDGs agenda.  2015 was the target for MDGs.“About 795 million people are undernourished globally, down 167 million over the last decade, and 216 million less than in 1990-92. The decline is more pronounced in developing regions, despite significant population growth,” the report states.Yet according to Vincent Ssempijja Bamulangaki, the State Minister for Agriculture, the issue of food security in a country that is endowed with two planting seasons raises more questions than answers.“We still have problems in agriculture, especially in the area of food security. We need to change the mindset of our people by educating them on what to do, especially when to plant, what to eat, how to store food and also teach them mechanisms of expanding into commercial agriculture,” he said.“Having 10m people under-fed is a huge number, and we have to look into the issue with a keen eye,” he added.Uganda has 36m people, according to the 2014 population census. There are 7.3m households countrywide.To curb he hunger figures, UN experts are suggesting an increase in the social protection systems in developing countries.“Social protection directly contributes to the reduction of poverty, hunger and malnutrition by promoting income security and access to better nutrition, health care and education. By improving human capacities and mitigating the impacts of shocks, social protection fosters the ability of the poor to participate in growth through better access to employment,” the report states.Christopher Mwanje, a nutrition and dietetics expert from Kyambogo University said that of the 10m projected hunger-stricken Ugandans, majority might be children but also the figure points to a great problem of ignorance on what to do.“People have land but they are not well-sensitised on what to do. Ignorance explains most of these deficiencies. Then those who have food don’t know how to eat properly. Even mothers who prepare food at home are not sensitized on what to feed the family,” he said. \t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1455287563552-0');\t\t\t\t\t\t});\t\t\t\t\t-->\t\t\t\t\t\tif (!window.OX_ads) { OX_ads = []; }\t\t\tOX_ads.push({ \"auid\" : \"538501068\" });\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdocument.write('');\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-->\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1476881418688-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1476881242577-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1455287729031-0');\t\t\t\t\t\t});\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1455287629526-0');\t\t\t\t\t\t});\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t10m Ugandans are under-fed - UN report\t\t\t\t\n",

      "By Vision ReporterPhilly Lutaaya Cares (PLC), an organization, promoting collective responsibility for the struggle against HIV/AIDS has trained over 200 Savings and Credit Cooperative (SACCO) members in Gomba district on the need to adopt the Permaculture philosophy of agriculture which uses a back-yard garden farming model to ensure sustainable food security and diet diversity in the community. Speaking about the SACCO training which was supported by the 30 corporate sector partners, Tezra Lutaaya, daughter to the late Lutaaya and Founder Member of PLC said, ‘Research has proven that food insecurity increases the chances of domestic violence which directly or indirectly contributes to the further spread of HIV/AIDS in communities. To this end, PLC saw it fit to empower the Gomba District SACCOs located in Kanoni - Koome, Kabutemba and Kitwe with free training on sustainable agricultural practices and energy-saving cooking techniques that ensure food security and improve the nutrition levels by using back yard gardens, which will in turn promotes spousal dialogue and lowers the chances of domestic violence hence directly contributing to the reduction of the spread of HIV/AIDS within the family and wider community.’ Kemigende Betesi, the Program Trainer who is also a small scale farmer from Ntungamo district where the Permaculture back-yard garden model has already been implemented said, ‘Through the Permaculture back-yard garden farming model, the 200 SACCO members can now use their small plots of land at the back of their houses that were in the past not utilized to grow a variety of food items such as vegetables using improved land allocation and demarcation techniques that utilizes small plots of land.’  Tezra Lutaaya noted that Philly Lutaaya’s parting words were \"My work here is done, but many years after I'm gone, people will continue the fight! The end is not in sight!\" To that end, the family through their Charity Organization Philly Lutaaya Cares has continued to use community engagements to address the issues of complacency, stigmatization, discrimination and alienation of HIV/AIDS victims and orphans, which gravely affects the AIDS fight in Uganda. LC 5 Chairman of Gomba district Hajji Kyabanji thanked Philly Lutaaya Cares for the SACCO training, citing that with food security and energy-saving addressed within the community, the women who have been baring the burden of fending food for their families can now concentrate within their homes’ back-yards and grow a variety of food for both home consumption and commercial benefits, since they can also sell some of it in markets. Lutaaya concluded by noting that Philly Lutaaya Cares will continue to boost the HIV/AIDS fight in Uganda, with the key concern being able to identify and promote “do-able” HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment behaviors that will achieve collective responsibility.\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { \t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1446561012149-0')\t\t\t\t\t\t\t;});\t\t\t\t\t\tRELATED STORIES:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1455287563552-0');\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1476881418688-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1476881242577-0'); });\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1455287729031-0');\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1455287629526-0');\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhilly Lutaaya: The legend lives onClimate change affecting food securityNine steps to food security\t\t\t\t\tPhilly Lutaaya Cares trains 200 on food security\t\t\t\t\n",
